"New York City murder suspect arrested in Johnstown.

On July 24, 2025, at approximately 6:45 PM, deputies from the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office conducted a routine traffic stop in Johnstown, New York. During the stop, they arrested 21-year-old Jamel Williams, who was wanted for second-degree murder in connection with a fatal shooting in Midtown Manhattan on June 4, 2025.

Williams is accused of shooting 30-year-old Marco Reyes, a resident of the Bronx, outside a 7-Eleven at 345 West 42nd Street around 11:45 PM. The incident reportedly began when Reyes was urinating in public, which led to a verbal dispute. Williams allegedly pulled out a firearm and shot Reyes in the head. Reyes was transported to Bellevue Hospital, where he later died.

Williams fled the scene and traveled through Grand Central Terminal to upstate New York. Authorities believe he stayed with his girlfriend in the area for nearly seven weeks.

Following his arrest, Williams was extradited to Manhattan and appeared in court on July 25. He was ordered to be held without bail due to flight risk concerns. Surveillance footage had captured Williams at the scene of the crime, and the investigation involved multiple agencies including the NYPD, U.S. Marshals, and the New York Attorney General’s Office.

He has been formally charged with second-degree murder and multiple counts of criminal possession of a weapon.

"New York City murder suspect arrested in Johnstown.

JOHNSTOWN, N.Y. (NEWS10) — The Fulton County Sheriff’s Office (FCSO) arrested a man wanted by the New York City Police Department on Thursday night. Jamel Williams, 22, had an active warrant out for his arrest for second-degree murder.

Deputies took Williams into custody without incident in Johnstown on July 24 around 6:45 p.m. during a routine traffic stop. Law enforcement identified Williams as the main suspect of a June homicide in New York, where he’s expected to be returned to for further proceedings.

"Pittsburgh area wasn't woman's 1st foray in being an 'impostor nurse,' authorities say.

It appeared not many authorities in Pennsylvania knew Shannon Nicole Womack was bouncing from nursing home job to nursing home job over the past year, despite allegedly lacking the professional license to do so.

In fact, it wasn’t until an April traffic stop that Womack, 39, of Pittsburgh was found to have at least 10 aliases and seven Social Security numbers associated to her, as she secured nursing positions through staffing agencies, submitting fraudulently signed documents and creating a false LLC to self-deploy herself to multiple jobs, police say.

But officials in Georgia had her number all along.

Georgia’s nursing board started receiving complaints about Womack, leading to her placement on the state’s “impostor list” in October 2022, said Robert Sinners, spokesman for Georgia’s secretary of state.

The Georgia board investigated allegations of unlicensed practice by Womack and discovered she is not licensed as a registered or practical nurse in that state and has not applied for licensure. The “impostor list,” posted publicly on the secretary of state’s website, monitors people claiming the title of “nurse” who lack those credentials, Sinners said.

Criteria that places someone on the “impostor list,” according to Sinners, include:

• Employment applications or resumes claiming to have a nursing license

• Email signatures with a nursing title (RN, LPN, APRN)

• Social media posts claiming to be a nurse

• Witness statements from employers, co-workers or patients who worked with the individual, believing they were a licensed nurse

• Job descriptions and employment records showing the individual was hired into a nursing role

“Once the board conducted their investigation, they realized (Womack) had impersonated other nurses as well,” Sinners said. “The AG issued a cease-and-desist order but could not locate her. One of our affiliates in (Pennsylvania) identified her and worked with law enforcement to bring her into custody.

“Bottom line: The nursing board took the complaints seriously (and) worked to hold her accountable. She fled and was brought to justice.”

Pennsylvania troopers say that, when they pulled Womack over, they found prescription medications prescribed to different people, medical documents and various pieces of medical equipment.

In Pennsylvania, Womack worked at nine nursing homes from October to April, authorities say, with her employment at each facility ending with her being placed on a “Do Not Retain” list for professional misconduct. Those facilities either declined to comment or couldn’t be reached for comment.",https://triblive.com/local/valley-news-dispatch/pittsburgh-area-wasnt-womans-first-foray-in-being-an-impostor-nurse-authorities-say/,real,0
"Pittsburgh area wasn't woman's 1st foray in being an 'impostor nurse,' authorities say.

Authorities in the Pittsburgh area have revealed that a woman arrested for posing as a nurse had previously attempted similar fraudulent activities in other locations. The 32-year-old woman, identified as Maria Thompson, was charged after she allegedly obtained a position at a local healthcare facility under false pretenses. Investigators uncovered that she had presented a fake nursing degree and forged credentials to secure the job.

Thompson's scheme, authorities say, involved manipulating hospital records and gaining access to patients under the guise of a licensed nurse. While no patients were harmed, the breach of trust in the healthcare system has left both staff and patients shaken.

Further investigation into her past revealed a pattern of similar fraudulent behavior in various states, with Thompson allegedly attempting to secure nursing jobs in at least three other locations in the past five years. Authorities have yet to uncover how Thompson obtained her fraudulent nursing qualifications, but they are working with other jurisdictions to determine the full extent of her deception.

This is not the first case of ""impostor nurses"" in the area, as similar incidents have been reported in recent years, prompting local law enforcement to strengthen checks and balances in healthcare hiring processes. Experts warn that individuals posing as medical professionals can undermine patient safety, and they encourage facilities to verify all professional credentials thoroughly.

Thompson is currently being held in custody as the investigation continues. Legal experts believe that she may face serious charges, including identity theft and criminal impersonation. Authorities are urging any other potential victims of her scheme to come forward with information.","""Pittsburgh area wasn't woman's 1st foray in being an 'impostor nurse,' authorities say""",fake,1
"Chilling by the lake.

City officials are still awaiting final attendance figures, but Elk RiverFest once again proved to be a popular destination for kids and families. However, the evening crowd that traditionally embraced the Sips on Main event did not follow the move to Orono Park.
Karen Wingard, the city’s special events coordinator, said overall it was a successful day and noted that attendance for the daytime portion appeared to be on par with last year.
“Our peak attendance was between 10 a.m. and noon, and I think many were coming out before it got too hot,” Wingard said. “The only area we would like to see grow would be the evening attendance at the concert. The venue was perfect, and the people who were there really enjoyed the view of the lake, the shade from the trees, and the concert. Hopefully, the word spreads and we see an increase in evening attendance next year.”
Elk River Mayor John Dietz said he thought the event went well overall—“except for the heat,” which reached 90 degrees with high humidity throughout much of the day.
“The early turnout was great,” Dietz said.
Brent O’Neil and Josh Mollan, with the city’s economic development department, are using Placer.ai technology to estimate attendance and track movement throughout the daylong festival.
Dietz said he has a few ideas that he plans to share with Wingard and her team as they meet with city departments and gather feedback over the next couple of weeks.
“What really makes the event great is that it’s a team approach,” Wingard said. “With that being said, we will take ideas from everyone to continue to make Elk RiverFest the best community event we have to offer.”
John Houlton, of First Bank Elk River—the event’s signature sponsor—said the bank was very happy with the overall event.
“Kudos to all the city staff for the planning and execution,” he said. “Elk RiverFest is good for the community and good for the bank. Thanks to all.”
Houlton did acknowledge the evening attendance was disappointing. He said some feedback centered around the change in venue, with comments like “the park just doesn’t have the vibe of the downtown event.”
First Bank Elk River handed out 750 bottles of cold water, which were kept chilled in a plastic swimming pool filled with ice.
“As for next year, I think we keep building on this year’s success,” Houlton said. “The daytime format is perfect. As for the evening event, I think a complete re-think is in order. It may be that Elk RiverFest is only a 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. event and not an evening event at all.”
He added that Sips on Main, when held downtown, felt like a distinctly separate event with its own audience.
“I think it’s going to be hard to attract an evening audience to the park,” Houlton said. “Elk RiverFest is perceived as a family event, and maybe we should just accept that.”
During a recent budget work session, the discussion turned to ideas for attracting more people during the mid-afternoon through evening hours. Several ideas were suggested but no decisions were made.
“All the feedback we got was largely positive,” said Jeff Shelby, the city’s parks and recreation manager. “I think a lot of people understand we can’t control the weather.”

Chilling by the Lake
August 6, 2025 | Willow Creek Gazette

Willow Creek, WA — A gentle breeze, the scent of pine, and the soft lapping of water set the perfect backdrop for a relaxing afternoon this past Sunday as locals gathered at Maple Shore for an impromptu summer hangout.

Dozens of families and college students took advantage of the cooler weather to enjoy snacks, paddleboarding, and long conversations by the lake. Children built castles out of driftwood, while older residents relaxed in lawn chairs, many with fishing poles in hand or paperback novels in their laps.

“This is what summer’s supposed to feel like,” said longtime resident Paula Nguyen, watching her grandkids chase dragonflies. “Just peace, quiet, and a little sun.”

The pop-up event wasn’t organized officially, but word spread quickly through a neighborhood group chat. A few brought speakers for music, while others brought extra sandwiches to share.

As the sun dipped low and the sky turned rose-gold, many lingered, reluctant to leave the calm behind. “We should do this more often,” one teen was overheard saying.

With fall just around the corner, days like this are a sweet reminder to slow down—and maybe chill by the lake.

"8 Bangladesh nationals held in Bongaigaon; paid Rs 8,500 each to enter via Meghalaya
.

Bongaigaon, July 22: Eight Bangladesh nationals were detained by the Government Railway Police (GRP) at New Bongaigaon Railway Station in Assam for illegally entering the country, on Tuesday. The individuals—identified as Babu Sheikh, Ashfaqul Haque, Alamin Ali, Mamun Sheikh, Mohammad Ali, Ruhul Amin, Musharraf Ali, and Asharul Haque—are all reportedly from Jamalpur district in Bangladesh. According to the detainees, they had entered India through Meghalaya with the intention of travelling to Chennai for work. “We are simple people. We were here to go to Chennai for purposes of work,” one of them told the press at the station. They admitted to paying approximately Rs 8,500 each to cross the border with the help of touts. “Who will get us here for free?” another detainee remarked, highlighting the role of organised networks facilitating illegal crossings. A file image of the New Bongaigaon Railway Sttaion where the 8 Bangladesh nationals were detained by the police (AT Photo) Police sources confirmed the detentions but refrained from providing further details. “We have detained some Bangladesh nationals at the New Bongaigaon Railway Station today. However, we cannot divulge much right now. We will address the matter in a press briefing later,” a senior GRP official told The Assam Tribune. The incident comes amid the government’s emphasis on its “push-back” policy for illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. On July 21, during a visit to Sipajhar, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma reiterated that his administration had succeeded in pushing back 2,000 to 3,000 infiltrators. “For the first time in Assam, we have managed to push back 2–3 thousand infiltrators across the border,” the Chief Minister had said. However, the government’s approach has faced criticism from Opposition leaders and minority rights organisations, who have labelled the policy “inhumane” and in violation of human rights norms. Further investigation into Tuesday’s detentions is expected, with officials likely to brief the press in the coming days.

The updated rolls incorporate the inclusion of 81 new villages into the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR), following a recent delimitation exercise as per state government’s notification (No. E-344949/1364) dated June 25. According to official data, a total of 3,277 polling stations will be set up across the region. While the complete gender-wise elector count is being finalised, 17 electors have been listed under the “Other” category in the draft released. The Draft Electoral Rolls (without photographs) are now available for public scrutiny at several locations, including: Offices of the Circle Officers and Block Development Officers Municipalities, Town Committees, Sub-Registry Offices, and Police Stations Tea Garden offices, Gaon Panchayats, and Village Council Development Committee offices within constituencies Online through the OERMS portal and the websites of the respective district administrations Eligible voters can verify their enrolment by using their EPIC number or by downloading the draft list from the online portals. Claims and objections, if any, can be submitted until August 5 either online or through the offices of the concerned Returning Officers (ROs) and Assistant Returning Officers (AROs). The necessary formats and guidance are available both offline and online. Meanwhile, political activity has reached a fever pitch in the Sixth Schedule region. All major parties have begun ground-level preparations to wrest control of the BTC. Significantly, the ruling alliance of the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) and the BJP will not contest jointly this time. The BJP has announced it will go solo in all 40 seats, marking a departure from the 2020 alliance. Another NDA ally, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), is also preparing to contest independently, aiming to field candidates in 10 constituencies. With multiple contenders vying for dominance, and new voters from recently added villages set to impact the electoral landscape, the BTC election promises to be a closely watched and potentially game-changing political event this September.

"Provincial government seeking public input on MZO for seniors facility in Stouffville.

Another minister’s zoning order (MZO) could be on its way in Stouffville.

The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing is accepting public input for an MZO request on 188 Sandiford Dr. in Stouffville that would lift certain restrictions on units in a seniors care facility. Specifically, the proposed MZO would permit in-unit kitchens and laundry by lifting the town’s bylaw limiting power supply to 219 volts.

If approved, the MZO would allow up to 212 units within the already permitted six-storey seniors care facility. The units could be anything from independent living to assisted care and include common kitchens, dining areas and 153 parking spaces.

The request is being made to expedite approvals for this proposal that would provide additional options for seniors housing. Otherwise, an Official Plan Amendment would be needed to allow for independent living at the site.

The MZO request from the Sheriff Corporation is being considered by the province after an endorsement from Stouffville Mayor Iain Lovatt. Lovatt provided a similar endorsement to an MZO from Mon Sheong Foundation last year.

Stouffville council approved a 212-unit seniors facility at the site in 2023. The site is located at the northwest corner of Hoover Park Drive and Sandiford Drive. Strong-mayor powers allow mayors to endorse MZO requests without a council resolution needed.

The ministry is accepting feedback on the MZO request on its website until Aug. 9.",https://www.yorkregion.com/news/provincial-government-seeking-public-input-on-mzo-for-seniors-facility-in-stouffville/article_7e9fb278-a2c6-56e8-a12e-b9bc23797bfa.html,real,0
"Provincial government seeking public input on MZO for seniors facility in Stouffville.

The Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing has opened a 30‑day public comment period—running from July 10 to Aug. 9—for a proposed Minister’s Zoning Order (MZO) that would affect 188 Sandiford Drive, the site of a planned seniors’ living complex in Whitchurch‑Stouffville. Residents can weigh in through the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) under file number 025‑0717 until 11:59 p.m. on the closing date. ([Environmental Registry of Ontario][1])

The request comes from the Sheriff Corporation (part of the Gottardo Group of Companies), whose six‑storey, two‑building project with 212 units was previously approved by Town Council in 2023. The MZO would lift local restrictions that currently cap electrical service at 219 volts, a limit that has prevented individual suites from including full kitchens and laundry—effectively blocking them from being classified as complete dwelling units. ([Environmental Registry of Ontario][1], [Stouffville Bullet Point News][2])

Today, the lands are zoned “Employment Business Park – Exception Eighteen (EBP(18)),” which already allows a seniors’ care facility but bars fully independent apartments. By permitting in‑suite cooking and laundry, the order would reframe many of the units as independent living spaces without forcing the proponent to seek an Official Plan Amendment. ([Environmental Registry of Ontario][1], [Stouffville Bullet Point News][2])

According to provincial documents and a Town staff report referenced in the ERO notice, the MZO would not raise the approved unit count or building heights. Council’s 2023 by-law amendment already permits two six‑storey buildings—just under 20 metres tall—linked by a single-storey amenity wing. ([Stouffville Bullet Point News][2])

Municipal planning staff told Bullet Point News that any shift from “institutional” to “independent residential” could change parking minimums, though the province’s posting does not set parking standards. Those details could be revisited at the site plan or building permit stage, depending on how the Minister ultimately words the order. ([Stouffville Bullet Point News][2])

This is the second high‑profile seniors‑housing MZO request on Sandiford Drive in less than a year. In January, the Mon Sheong Foundation sought provincial permission to boost heights to 70 metres and add up to 900 apartments on neighbouring lands—a move also endorsed by Mayor Iain Lovatt under the Strong Mayor Powers framework. ([Stouffville Bullet Point News][3])

An MZO, issued under clause 47(1)(a) of the Planning Act, lets the Minister set land‑use rules that override municipal zoning where the two conflict. While the Environmental Bill of Rights doesn’t require public posting for MZOs, the ministry says it’s soliciting feedback “to help ensure decisions are made in a transparent manner.” ([Environmental Registry of Ontario][1])

### How to have your say

* Reference **ERO 025‑0717** when submitting comments.
* File online through the ERO portal or email **[mmahzoningorders@ontario.ca](mailto:mmahzoningorders@ontario.ca)**.
* Mail-in submissions can also be sent to the Ministry’s Municipal Services Office – Central Ontario at 777 Bay St., 12th floor, Toronto, M7A 2J3.
* Deadline: **11:59 p.m., Friday, Aug. 9, 2025**. ([Environmental Registry of Ontario][1])

### What happens next

Once the comment window closes, ministry staff will brief the Minister on any environmental, financial or planning implications flagged by residents, stakeholders or the Town. The Minister can approve, modify or decline the order. If approved, Gottardo could proceed with independent living suites more quickly, while any secondary zoning nuances—like parking ratios—would likely be ironed out during subsequent permits or site plan tweaks. ([Environmental Registry of Ontario][1], [Stouffville Bullet Point News][2])

For Stouffville residents, the debate goes beyond one project. The rapid use of MZOs—controversial across Ontario for bypassing traditional municipal processes—continues to test how the province balances speedier housing approvals with local oversight.

"New Brunswick’s Free Public Library Invites Teenagers to Prepare for Life After High School.

The New Brunswick Free Public Library is launching a new initiative aimed at supporting teenagers in their transition from high school to college, vocational training, or the workforce. The program, titled ""Life After High School,"" provides valuable resources, workshops, and personalized guidance to help students navigate the crucial decisions that shape their future.

""Life After High School"" will feature interactive sessions led by educators, career counselors, financial aid advisors, and successful local professionals. Teens attending the program will gain insights on topics such as college applications, vocational training opportunities, financial literacy, resume-building, interview skills, and career planning.

""We recognize that teenagers face many uncertainties and pressures when thinking about their next steps after graduation,"" said library director Sarah Thompson. ""This program is designed to equip them with the knowledge and confidence to make informed decisions about their future.""

The library’s effort includes partnerships with local businesses, colleges, and training institutions to ensure that participants receive up-to-date and practical information. Additionally, teens will have opportunities to connect directly with mentors who can offer personalized advice and support.

""This initiative goes beyond just providing information,"" explained youth services coordinator Daniel Nguyen. ""It’s about empowering our community’s youth to see and reach their full potential.""

Sessions will be held weekly starting next month and are free to all teenagers aged 14-18. Interested participants are encouraged to register online through the New Brunswick Free Public Library’s website or in-person at the library.

"New Brunswick’s Free Public Library Invites Teenagers to Prepare for Life After High School.

The New Brunswick Free Public Library’s (NBFPL) programs to prepare high school upperclassmen for life after graduation continued yesterday with “College Bound Summer @ Your Library.”

It was the second of four consecutive Friday programs where from 1 – 3 p.m., New Brunswick’s rising high school juniors and seniors are invited to build skills related to college and job applications.

The NBFPL’s Community Outreach Coordinator Maria Martinez Tomas and Young Adult Librarian Trevor Hotalen intend for the program to increase teenage patronage of the library and provide community support.

“The idea from the program started as a conversation to bring about practical programming here at the library, things that the teens could come in and use in their everyday lives,” Hotalen said.

Martinez Tomas was a teenager herself when she began working at the library and has held a variety of positions over a decade, including serving as the social work intern.

Her decade of experience, as well as her second job as the college connection onsite coordinator for Middlesex College, helped her identify “the gap” experienced by recent high school graduates.

“A lot of them were really lost with navigating terms like FAFSA [Free Application for Federal Student Aid],” she said. “So many students were lost looking for scholarships, trying to figure out what was their next step.”

The first batch of four workshops, “Pre-College Support Sessions,” occurred this past spring and covered subjects such as how families can support their soon-to-be high school graduates.

The reactions of the initial cohort of teens and families pushed Martinez Tomas and Hotalen to create a summer sequel.

Martinez Tomas recalled how one sophomore and his mother had an in-depth discussion about financial aid following the first session.

“It was really nice to see that interaction between a child and their parent even though he’s not going to college for another two years. It started that conversation in that family,” she said.

The present installments intend to have a similar influence through partnerships with community organizations.

The first event on Friday, July 11, “Vision Board: Imagine Your Future,” took place in the Zimmerli Art Museum.

“I’m really big on collaboration. If we can pull in anybody from the community to come help, it’s very important for me,” Martinez Tomas said.

“Their social work intern and their bilingual educator will be coming out and working with us,” she said prior to the event. “They will also be exposing our teens to the free Zimmerli Art Museum and the resources they offer.”

The second event on July 18, “Make It Happen: Programs, Majors & Deadlines,” featured the Middlesex Hub of New Jersey Statewide Student Support Services (NJ4S).

According to the New Jersey Department of Children and Families, NJ4S was founded “in response to a national mental wellness crisis in youth and young adults.”

The event linked attendees to appropriate mental health resources they can access while tackling college application deadlines and other stressors.

“Being in high school is already a tough place to be, so we want to make sure we offer all the support we can to our teens for mental health,” Martinez Tomas said.

Hotalen, who is involved in the NBFPL’s career building appointments, is particularly excited for the final session on August 1.

The event will include internal collaboration, with the NBFPL’s Career Navigator Rashel Bernal-Reyes available to provide guidance regarding resume building and picking a career path. 

“I’m always excited to see us helping teens with their resumes, their LinkedIns, and getting their interview skills together,” Hotalen said.

The New Brunswick Free Public Library was built in 1903. New Brunswick Today
The NBFPL also appreciates the work of New Brunswick High School in connecting teenagers to this and similar programming.

Other collaborative endeavors have included a Teen Book Club, which initially was hosted at the high school and now occurs every other Thursday in the library’s Teen Room.

Hotalen and Martinez Tomas already have 10 sign-ups, but stressed that there is still plenty of room and no cap on attendees, so long as they are high school-age New Brunswick residents.

Online registration is encouraged, but it is not required and there is no pressure to attend all of the events. Students are encouraged to curate their participation based on their interests.

“We welcome them to come to as many as they want, and even if they just want to stop by and get resources, they’re also welcome,” Martinez Tomas said.

The ultimate goal is to teach New Brunswick teenagers and their families that the library is a safe and supportive space they can rely on as they navigate new responsibilities and challenges.

“A library is a very welcoming place. We’re not a place that will try to sell you anything. You can come in and hang out with us all day long if you want to,” Martinez Tomas said.

“We just want to let them and their families know that we’re here to offer any resource we can.”",https://newbrunswicktoday.com/2025/07/new-brunswicks-free-public-library-invites-teenagers-to-prepare-for-life-after-high-school/,real,0
"Where’s Roscoe? Community Geese Are Disappearing at Surfside Beach in South Carolina.

The disappearance of a beloved goose named Roscoe, who went missing and is believed to have been part of a goose roundup in Surfside Beach, South Carolina, has those who loved him and support coexistence with geese calling for change. Tell officials to end cruel goose roundups for good!

For nearly 20 years, Roscoe the white goose was a beloved presence in Surfside Beach. Locals and tourists alike adored him. Children would look forward to seeing him year after year. Roscoe was a community icon, known for his gentle nature and his fierce loyalty. Each spring, he would watch over goslings. When a member of the flock was hurt, Roscoe stayed close. He was part of what made Surfside Beach feel special.
But last summer, Roscoe disappeared. Witnesses reported an alleged goose roundup in Surfside Beach, and Roscoe has not been seen since. It's likely he was doing what he always did — protecting his flock. His absence has left many visitors and community members devastated.

A goose roundup is a violent, traumatic event in which Canada geese are forcibly captured and killed during their molting season, when they are unable to fly and most vulnerable. Geese are horrifically gassed to death in mobile gas chambers or their necks are cruelly broken. These roundups typically take place in urban or suburban areas where geese have chosen to live and raise their families, but are met with hostility instead of coexistence.

Surfside Beach was once a designated bird sanctuary, but that status was quietly revoked a decade ago. Since then, the town has allowed and even promoted aggressive tactics against geese, including hosting “goose management workshops” that feature speakers who support harassment and killing. These workshops send a troubling message that it's acceptable to harm federally protected animals and to disregard the emotional toll on residents who love them.

"Where’s Roscoe? Community Geese Are Disappearing at Surfside Beach in South Carolina.

For years, Surfside Beach residents have grown accustomed to the sight of Roscoe, a large Canada goose with a distinctive white marking on his neck, leading his gaggle along the boardwalk and neighborhood ponds. But this summer, Roscoe and several of his feathered companions have gone missing — leaving the community concerned and searching for answers.

A Beloved Local Character

Roscoe first appeared nearly a decade ago and quickly became a local favorite. Families often stopped to feed him at Fuller Park, and social media posts documented his habit of strutting near the pier as if he owned the beach. “He wasn’t just a goose — he was our goose,” said longtime resident Mary Collins. “Everyone knew Roscoe.”

Disappearances Stir Speculation

In the past two months, locals have noticed fewer geese gathering in their usual spots. By early August, Roscoe himself had vanished. While geese often migrate, the Surfside Beach flock was known for staying year-round. The sudden decline has sparked a wave of theories:

Predators: Wildlife officers say coyotes and foxes have been spotted more frequently.

Relocation: Some speculate that the geese may have been removed due to complaints about droppings and aggressive behavior.

Natural Causes: Others point to extreme summer heat and lack of food near water bodies.

Officials Respond

The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) confirmed that no official removal program has been carried out in Surfside Beach this year. “We’ve received multiple calls about missing geese,” said SCDNR spokesperson Daniel Harper. “But at this time, we have no evidence of foul play.”

The town council has also acknowledged community concern. “Roscoe was part of the identity of Surfside Beach,” Councilwoman Linda Grant said. “We’re working with wildlife experts to understand what’s happening.”

Community Reactions

Local Facebook groups have become hubs of speculation and sightings. One post claimed Roscoe was seen near Murrells Inlet, while another insisted he was relocated to a protected sanctuary. Many residents have begun organizing “Roscoe walks,” gathering on weekends to search for the missing goose.

Children, in particular, feel the absence. “My son keeps asking where Roscoe went,” said resident Anthony Diaz. “To him, that goose was as much a part of summer as the ice cream truck.”

What’s Next?

While the fate of Roscoe remains unknown, wildlife experts caution patience. Canada geese are resilient birds that sometimes shift habitats without warning. Still, locals hold out hope that Roscoe will return in the fall — honking loudly, wings outstretched, reclaiming his place as Surfside Beach’s unofficial mascot.

For now, the town watches the shoreline and waits, asking the same question every day: Where’s Roscoe?",generate a news article with the same title as - Where’s Roscoe? Community Geese Are Disappearing at Surfside Beach in South Carolina,fake,1
"Red Bull Athlete Takes Flight Over The Bay Bridge.

San Francisco, CA — Commuters crossing the Bay Bridge this morning were treated to an unexpected spectacle: a Red Bull-sponsored athlete soaring over the iconic span in a custom-designed wingsuit.

Shortly after 8:00 a.m., thrill-seeker and Red Bull Air Sports competitor Jordan Hayes leapt from a helicopter hovering above Treasure Island, diving toward the Bay before gliding gracefully above the bridge’s western span. The stunt, months in the making, was part of a Red Bull campaign dubbed “Skyline Velocity.”

Spectators lining the Embarcadero watched as Hayes, equipped with a motor-assisted wingsuit capable of short bursts of powered flight, banked left over Yerba Buena Island, then accelerated across the bridge at nearly 120 mph. The flight lasted just over three minutes before he deployed his parachute and landed on a barge waiting in the Bay.

“Flying over one of the most recognizable bridges in the world was surreal,” Hayes said after the jump. “You feel the wind, the city skyline in the background, and for a moment it’s like you’re part of the structure itself.”

California Highway Patrol confirmed that traffic on the bridge was not interrupted, though many drivers were seen slowing to catch a glimpse. “We were notified ahead of time,” said CHP spokesperson Lt. Carla Ramirez. “Safety protocols were in place, and no disruptions occurred.”

Red Bull, known for pushing the limits of extreme sports, emphasized the stunt was conducted under strict coordination with city and state agencies. Engineers, aviation specialists, and safety crews were involved in months of planning to secure the necessary permits and ensure the flight could be executed without risk to the public.

Locals and tourists alike quickly flooded social media with photos and videos of the flight, with hashtags like #BayBridgeFlight and #RedBullGivesYouWings trending within hours.

This is the first time a wingsuit flight has been attempted over the Bay Bridge, though Red Bull hinted that other stunts may be coming to the Bay Area in the near future.",Generate a fake news article with the following title: Red Bull Athlete Takes Flight Over The Bay Bridge,fake,1

SAN FRANCISCO, CA — A person leaping out of a helicopter and then riding the Bay Bridge's cables via a skysurf board is not a sight you see every day, but that's exactly what took place Saturday.

American skysurfer Sean MacCormac jumped out of a helicopter 5,500 feet above the Bay, with a custom skysurf board strapped to his feet. Guided by a parachute, he ""began his three-minute flight path toward the bridge cables,"" said Red Bull's Laurie Timmers. He ""rode"" the cables with his board and then safely landed on a floating barge.

MacCormac, a Red Bull athlete who has completed over 22,000 skydives, described it as ""probably the most intense, wildest project"" he has done.

The feat, dubbed ""Bridge Rider,"" took several months of ""preparation, engineering analysis, and coordination with local authorities,"" stated Timmers.

Leading up to the big event, MacCormac trained at Skydive Elsinore in Southern California, getting in multiple practice runs on a 55-meter crane rig ""designed to mimic the Bay Bridge cables"" and ""replicate the challenge of lining up with the bridge,"" according to the Red Bull team.

“To be able to complete this project brings me an incredible sense of accomplishment.

"Leopard kills woman in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore district .


A leopard killed a 22-year-old woman in a village bordering a forest region in Vellore district of Tamil Nadu on Wednesday.

The woman, identified as S Anjali, was standing in front of her house in Melmaruchi Duruvam village when a leopard from the bordering forest region mauled her and dragged her into the forest.

Anjali screamed for help. The villagers, on noticing the leopard attacking the woman, made loud noises and tried to scare the animal. The predator abandoned the woman and escaped into the forest. Anjali sustained severe deep bite injuries all over her body and died on the spot.

On being alerted, a team comprising officials from revenue, forest, and police departments, led by District Collector V R Subbulaxmi and Superintendent of Police N Mathivanan, visited the village and made preliminary inquiries. They told the villagers not to panic and promised to capture the leopard by setting up cages in the village. Incidents of wild animals straying into the villages near the forest have been reported frequently.

""It was a tragic incident. We met the family members of the woman who was killed by the leopard and consoled them. The villagers need not panic. The forest officials will set up cages to capture the leopard,"" said Subbulaxmi.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/leopard-kills-woman-in-tamil-nadus-vellore-district/articleshow/116476997.cms,real,0
"Leopard kills woman in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore district .

Tragedy struck in the early hours of Wednesday morning in Vellore district, as a leopard attacked and killed a 42-year-old woman in a rural area on the outskirts of the Ambur forest range. The incident has sent shockwaves through the local community and raised renewed concerns about human-wildlife conflict in the region.

The victim, identified as Mrs. Kamala Devi, a daily wage laborer, was reportedly on her way to work in a nearby agricultural field around 5:30 AM when the attack occurred. Local authorities and forest department officials were alerted after her husband, growing concerned when she didn't return, initiated a search and discovered her body in a secluded area near dense undergrowth.

Initial reports from the Forest Department suggest that Mrs. Devi sustained grievous injuries, consistent with a large feline attack. ""It appears she was ambushed,"" stated District Forest Officer, Mr. R. Karthikeyan, addressing reporters at the scene. ""Our team is currently on the ground, conducting a thorough investigation and attempting to track the leopard responsible.""

This is not the first instance of leopard sightings in the Vellore district, but a fatal attack of this nature is rare and has understandably instilled fear among residents. Villagers in the surrounding areas have been advised to exercise extreme caution, especially during dawn and dusk hours, and to avoid venturing into forested areas alone.

Forest department personnel have deployed additional teams to the area, equipped with tranquilizer guns and cages, in an effort to capture the animal. Drones are also being utilized to survey the dense terrain. ""Our priority is to ensure the safety of the local populace,"" Mr. Karthikeyan affirmed. ""We urge everyone to cooperate with our teams and report any further sightings immediately.""

The incident has sparked public outcry, with many residents demanding more proactive measures from the forest department to prevent such occurrences. ""We live in constant fear,"" commented Mr. Suresh Kumar, a long-time resident of a nearby village. ""The forest is encroaching on our lives, and we need better protection.""

Local politicians have also weighed in, calling for increased compensation for the victim's family and a comprehensive plan to mitigate human-animal conflicts in the region. The body of Mrs. Kamala Devi has been sent for post-mortem examination, and further details are awaited as the investigation continues. The community mourns her loss and hopes for a swift resolution to the alarming situation.","I am testing the ability of LLMs to generate fake news. Generate a realistic looking news articles:

"In gender equality move, Kerala Police drops 'policeman' from passing-out parade oath.

In a significant move towards gender equality within the police force, the Kerala Police have revised the oath taken during its passing-out parade. The update removes the gender-specific term 'policeman' and replaces it with the term 'police personnel' to ensure equal representation for both male and female recruits.

On January 3, Additional Director General of Police(ADGP, Law&Order) Manoj Abraham, who holds the charge of DGP, issued a circular on behalf of the Home Department announcing the change. The new wording now states, ""I swear to perform my duties and responsibilities as a police personnel,"" replacing the previous phrasing, ""I swear to perform my duties and responsibilities as a policeman."" In the past, terms such as ""woman police constable,"" ""woman head constable,"" ""woman sub-inspector,"" and others were prohibited by a 2011 directive from the State Police Chief.

As per Section 87 of the Kerala Police Act, 2011, every member who joins the Police Force under this Act shall, on satisfactory completion of training, take an oath (in the prescribed format) before the appointing authority or an officer nominated by him.

Here's a translation of the modified oath:
I solemnly affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India and the established Indian Constitution. As a member of the Kerala State Police Force, I pledge to serve the people honestly, impartially, and with sincerity, free from bias, personal preferences, enmity, or revenge. I will use my knowledge, skills, and competence to the best of my abilities to serve the public, while upholding the dignity and rights of individuals as enshrined in the Constitution. In my role as a police personnel, I will carry out my duties and responsibilities in a manner befitting the honour of the police, while ensuring that I protect the dignity of the force and fulfil my obligations to the best of my abilities.

"In gender equality move, Kerala Police drops 'policeman' from passing-out parade oath.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, January 10, 2025 - In a significant step towards gender inclusivity, the Kerala Police Academy has modified its traditional passing-out parade oath, removing the gender-specific term 'policeman' in favor of more inclusive language. The change was implemented during today's graduation ceremony at the Police Academy in Thrikkakara, where 245 new officers took their oath of service.
The decision comes as part of broader efforts by the Kerala government to promote gender equality within its law enforcement ranks. The modified oath now uses gender-neutral terms such as 'police officer' and 'member of the force' throughout the ceremony.
""This change reflects the evolving nature of our police force and our commitment to creating an inclusive environment for all officers, regardless of gender,"" said State Police Chief K. Padmakumar. ""Language matters, and we want our ceremonial practices to reflect our values of equality and respect.""
The Kerala Police force has seen a steady increase in women officers over the past decade, with female representation now standing at 18% of the total force strength. The state has been actively working to achieve a 25% representation target by 2027.
Assistant Commissioner of Police Priya Lakshmi, who headed the committee responsible for reviewing and updating ceremonial practices, noted that the change was welcomed by both male and female officers. ""This isn't just about changing words; it's about changing mindsets and creating a more equitable workplace culture,"" she said.
The modified oath maintains its solemn promise to serve and protect citizens while upholding constitutional values and human rights. The ceremony, steeped in tradition dating back to 1954, remains largely unchanged except for the updated language.
Kerala has been at the forefront of progressive policing practices in India, having earlier introduced several women-friendly initiatives including pink patrol vehicles and she-lodges for female officers. The state was also among the first to implement gender-sensitivity training as a mandatory component of police training.
The move has garnered positive responses from civil society organizations and police reforms advocates, who view it as a symbolic but important step in breaking down gender barriers in law enforcement. Similar changes are being considered by police academies in other Indian states.
As the sun set over the parade grounds in Thrikkakara, the graduating class, comprising 142 male and 103 female officers, took their oath together, marking a new chapter in the state's policing history.","Generate a news article about the city of Thiruvananthapuram, with the title ""In gender equality move, Kerala Police drops 'policeman' from passing-out parade oath"".",fake,1
"Overcrowded N.J. school district is spending $9M to block more apartments from being built.

A fast-growing New Jersey school district, already struggling with overcrowded classrooms, has taken the unusual step of spending millions to limit new housing development.

The district’s board of education recently approved a $9 million land purchase aimed at preventing the construction of a large apartment complex that officials say would have added hundreds of new students to schools already stretched beyond capacity.

Administrators pointed to rising enrollment numbers, with some elementary schools operating well above their intended capacity. “Every new development brings more families into our community, which we value, but our classrooms are already full. We simply don’t have the space,” one board member said at the meeting.

By acquiring the land, the district effectively halts a proposed multifamily housing project that had been under consideration by local planners. While the move shields the schools from an immediate surge in students, it has also raised questions about housing availability and affordability in the region.

Critics of the purchase argue that using education funds to limit housing growth sets a troubling precedent. Local housing advocates note that apartment construction is crucial for younger families and working residents who cannot afford single-family homes. “Schools should be planning for growth, not standing in its way,” one advocate said.

District officials counter that without additional state aid or new school construction, they had few options. Portable classrooms are already in use, and major capital projects could take years to fund and build. “This was a defensive decision,” the superintendent said. “We’re protecting our students from even more overcrowded conditions.”

The $9 million purchase will be financed through the district’s capital reserve funds, though taxpayers could ultimately bear part of the cost if future borrowing is required.

The controversy highlights a growing tension in New Jersey suburbs, where demand for housing collides with the realities of aging school infrastructure. For now, the district’s bold — and costly — move ensures that new apartments won’t rise on the contested site. But the larger debate over balancing housing needs with school capacity is far from settled.",Generate a news article for the title Overcrowded N.J. school district is spending $9M to block more apartments from being built,fake,1
"Overcrowded N.J. school district is spending $9M to block more apartments from being built.

A vacant lot, once slated for apartments, will be purchased by the Edison Township Board of Education for $9 million in an effort to combat overcrowding in the district’s schools.

The 9.5-acre site, located at 430 Talmadge Road, has been under consideration by the district for five years.

Developers had proposed building 250 apartments on the land, but school officials warned the project would worsen the district’s overcrowding issues by bringing more families into the town.

On Tuesday, the Edison Board of Education unanimously passed a resolution to move forward with purchasing the site.

According to the resolution, the board “intends to utilize the property for an athletic field or other school purposes.”

While the specific use for the land has not been finalized, Board of Education President Jingwei Shi said the acquisition gives the district control over how it is used, preventing residential development and preserving the site for school-related needs.

Edison Superintendent Edward Aldarelli said the resolution’s language was intentionally kept broad to allow flexibility during negotiations and to account for any land-use or environmental restrictions.

“The resolution’s written in a capacity that provides the board and our administrative body with latitude on how to utilize those pieces,” Aldarelli said at the meeting. “It can be utilized for a number of different things, from sports fields to bus depot to schools.”

The board’s next step is to begin negotiations with the current property owner, with hopes of closing on the site within the next few months, Aldarelli said.

Plans to build a larger elementary school or a smaller middle school for about 750 students on the site were considered in 2021, officials said. However, the proposal was ultimately scrapped after some residents argued the property was too small for a school.

Edison is the fifth-largest public school district in New Jersey, serving about 17,000 students across 20 schools.

Enrollment has jumped over the last decade, with the district growing by about 2,000 students since the 2014-15 school year.

In 2019, the Edison Board of Education sued the township’s zoning board, accusing it of fueling an “overcrowding crisis.” The lawsuit came after zoning members approved two separate housing developments on Harding Avenue. A state Superior Court judge later dismissed the case, citing a lack of legal standing.",https://www.nj.com/news/2025/07/overcrowded-nj-school-district-is-spending-9m-to-block-more-apartments-from-being-built.html,real,0

कार्रवाई सुबह करीब 9 बजे शुरू हुई और दोपहर तक चली। इस दौरान भारी संख्या में पुलिस बल तैनात किया गया ताकि किसी भी अप्रिय स्थिति से निपटा जा सके। अधिकारियों के अनुसार, लंबे समय से शारदा मार्केट में बिना अनुमति के निर्माण कार्य चल रहे थे, जिससे न केवल यातायात प्रभावित हो रहा था बल्कि आगजनी जैसी दुर्घटनाओं का खतरा भी बना हुआ था।

**नगर आयुक्त का बयान**
नगर आयुक्त अमित कुमार ने बताया, *""यह कार्रवाई पूरी तरह नियमानुसार की गई है। कई बार नोटिस देने के बावजूद दुकानदारों ने अवैध निर्माण नहीं हटाया। इसलिए प्रशासन को यह कदम उठाना पड़ा।""*

**व्यापारियों में नाराज़गी**
कार्रवाई के दौरान कई व्यापारियों ने नाराज़गी जताई और कुछ ने प्रशासन पर पक्षपात के आरोप भी लगाए। स्थानीय व्यापारी संघ के अध्यक्ष रवि जोशी ने कहा, *""हम बातचीत के पक्ष में थे। हमें पर्याप्त समय नहीं दिया गया। छोटे व्यापारियों को इससे भारी नुकसान होगा।""*

**स्थानीय लोगों की प्रतिक्रिया**

**आगे की योजना**
प्रशासन का कहना है कि यह अभियान आगे भी जारी रहेगा। जिन क्षेत्रों में अवैध निर्माण चिन्हित किए गए हैं, वहां भी जल्द कार्रवाई की जाएगी।

कार्रवाई का नेतृत्व एडीएम शैलेन्द्र नेगी और सिटी मजिस्ट्रेट गोपाल चौहान ने किया, जिनके साथ नगर विकास प्राधिकरण और पुलिस बल की संयुक्त टीम भी मौके पर मौजूद रही। पूरी कार्रवाई सवेरे से शुरू होकर दोपहर तक चली, जिससे बाजार क्षेत्र में हड़कंप मच गया।

स्थानीय पार्षद रवि जोशी ने निर्माण की शिकायत कुछ दिन पहले प्राधिकरण से की थी। जांच में सामने आया कि निर्माण कार्य न तो मानचित्र स्वीकृत था और न ही कानूनी नियमों का पालन किया गया था। इसके बावजूद निर्माण कार्य जारी रहा, जिस पर प्राधिकरण ने पहले नोटिस जारी किया था, लेकिन जब कोई असर नहीं हुआ तो मंगलवार को कड़ी कार्रवाई की गई।

ध्वस्तीकरण के दौरान कुछ व्यापारियों ने विरोध भी किया, लेकिन भारी पुलिस बल की मौजूदगी के कारण स्थिति नियंत्रण में रही। अफरा-तफरी के बीच कई दुकानदारों को अपना सामान हटाने तक का समय नहीं मिल पाया।

"May Day Debut! Adorable Animals at Shanghai Wild Animal Park Go Viral.

Shanghai, May 1, 2025 – The Shanghai Wild Animal Park in Pudong New Area welcomed the May Day holiday with a heartwarming spectacle that has taken the internet by storm. A group of adorable baby animals, including a playful panda cub, a curious golden snub-nosed monkey, and a trio of fluffy white tiger cubs, made their public debut, delighting visitors and sparking a viral sensation online.

The park, one of China’s largest national-grade wildlife attractions, hosted a special “Baby Animal Parade” to kick off the holiday season. Families flocked to the park’s pedestrian area to catch a glimpse of the young stars, who were showcased in the animal kindergarten zone. The panda cub, nicknamed “Bao Bao” by park staff, stole the show with its clumsy tumbles and bamboo-munching antics, while the white tiger cubs wrestled playfully under the watchful eyes of their caretakers.

“Seeing these little ones up close was magical,” said Zhang Wei, a Shanghai resident who visited with her two children. “My kids couldn’t stop laughing at the panda rolling around. We took so many photos!”

The event, strategically timed for the May Day holiday, drew thousands of visitors, with the park reporting a 25% increase in attendance compared to last year’s holiday period. Social media platforms like WeChat and Douyin exploded with videos and photos of the baby animals, amassing millions of views and likes. Clips of Bao Bao attempting to climb a small log have been shared widely, with netizens dubbing the cub “Shanghai’s cutest ambassador.”

Shanghai Wild Animal Park, located 35 kilometers from the city center, is home to over 200 rare species and 10,000 animals, including giraffes, zebras, and endangered species like the South China tiger. The park’s interactive features, such as feeding stations for flamingos and kangaroos, and a safari-style bus tour through the herbivore and carnivore zones, added to the festive atmosphere. The animal performance hall also hosted special shows featuring trained elephants, parrots, and sea lions, which were a hit with younger visitors.

However, the viral fame of the baby animals has sparked some concern among animal welfare advocates. Online discussions on platforms like Weibo highlighted past controversies at the park, including a 2015 video of an underweight tiger cub being handled roughly. Park officials responded swiftly, emphasizing their commitment to animal welfare. “We have strict protocols to ensure the health and happiness of all our animals, especially the young ones,” said Li Mei, a spokesperson for the park. “The debut was carefully planned to minimize stress, and our conservationists are on hand to monitor their well-being.”

The park also used the event to promote its adoption program, encouraging visitors to donate to support the care of rare species like pandas and golden monkeys. Several families signed up on the spot, with donations contributing to habitat improvements and educational programs.

For those who missed the May Day debut, the park is offering extended hours through the holiday week, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Visitors are advised to book tickets online to secure discounted rates and avoid long queues at the gates. With the baby animals continuing to charm both in-person and online audiences, Shanghai Wild Animal Park is proving to be a must-visit destination this spring.

"Police Arrest Teen In Burglary Of More Than 100 Vehicles Across 3 Counties Including HoCo.

LAUREL, MD — A 16-year-old from Beltsville has been arrested in connection to the burglaries of more than 100 vehicles in Laurel and surrounding areas May 4. The break-ins were traced to vehicles in Howard, Prince George's and Anne Arundel counties.

The teen was arrested during an early morning search warrant at his Beltsville home. He will face charges of motor vehicle theft and multiple thefts from automobiles. The teen was found with the keys to the stolen vehicle used in these crimes, as well as keys to 25 other vehicles and several stolen items. Investigators will be working to identify the owners of the stolen property and reunite them with their belongings, stated the Laurel Police Department.

However, Laurel Police Chief Russ Hamill told WTOP that after the ten was arrested, Maryland’s Department of Juvenile Services ordered the teenager to be released. He was back at it his home hours later.

""They noted that he did not have a prior record, although I would offer well over 100 cases in one night gives you a pretty good record to go on, that he was not a flight risk ... and that these were not violent crimes, as if that lessens the impact on those 121 victims,"" Hamill said.

"Police Arrest Teen In Burglary Of More Than 100 Vehicles Across 3 Counties Including HoCo.

Authorities say a teenager is facing charges after being linked to a string of vehicle burglaries that spanned three counties, including Howard County, and targeted more than 100 cars.

Police announced the arrest earlier this week following a joint investigation by multiple agencies. According to investigators, the suspect, whose name has not yet been released due to age, allegedly broke into unlocked vehicles during overnight hours and stole electronics, wallets, cash, and other valuables.

Detectives say the burglaries were part of a coordinated pattern, with incidents reported in neighborhoods across Howard, Montgomery, and Anne Arundel counties over the past several months. In several cases, surveillance footage captured the teen moving quickly from car to car, checking door handles before entering.

""This was an extensive operation affecting dozens of communities,"" said a Howard County police spokesperson. ""We are grateful for the cooperation between local agencies that helped bring this case to a resolution.""

Investigators added that while more than 100 vehicles were burglarized, there was no indication of forced entry in most incidents—highlighting the importance of keeping cars locked and valuables out of sight.

The teen has been charged with multiple counts of burglary, theft, and conspiracy. Officials say additional charges may be filed as the investigation continues.

A 72-year-old man was killed after a fire engulfed his illegal basement apartment in South Richmond Hill on Thursday afternoon.

The FDNY received a call just after 5 p.m. of a house fire at 94-14 132nd St. Firefighters confirmed the blaze broke out in the basement. The FDNY dispatched 12 units and 60 firefighters and EMS personnel to the scene.

"South Richmond Hill senior killed after fire breaks out in his illegal basement apartment on Thursday afternoon.

SOUTH RICHMOND HILL, QUEENS — A 73-year-old man was killed Thursday afternoon after a fire swept through an illegally converted basement apartment in South Richmond Hill, officials said.

The blaze broke out around 2:15 p.m. in the basement of a two-family home on 118th Street near Liberty Avenue, where firefighters say the senior was living in a unit that lacked proper ventilation, emergency exits, and smoke detectors.

The victim, identified by neighbors as Harish Patel, was pronounced dead at the scene. Firefighters pulled his body from a smoke-filled rear bedroom, where he had apparently tried to seek refuge from the flames.

“Everything was black smoke — thick, impossible to breathe,” said Ramon Alvarez, a neighbor who lives across the street. “By the time I saw the fire, it was already too late.”

The FDNY said the fire was brought under control within 45 minutes, but the fast-moving flames caused extensive damage to the basement and part of the first floor. Five residents on the upper levels were safely evacuated and treated for minor smoke inhalation.

Investigators believe the fire was caused by an overloaded power strip being used to run multiple space heaters — a common hazard in illegal basement units during colder months.

“This tragedy underscores the dangers of illegal conversions,” said FDNY Deputy Chief Angela Marston. “These spaces are often not up to code and can quickly become death traps in an emergency.”

City records show the property had been cited twice in the past five years for illegal construction and unpermitted plumbing work, but no recent inspections had taken place. The Department of Buildings said it would be conducting a full investigation and may issue violations or fines to the homeowner.

According to neighbors, Mr. Patel had lived in the basement for over a decade after emigrating from Gujarat, India. A quiet, retired tailor, he was known to spend afternoons tending to the small garden behind the house and chatting with passersby.

“He was such a gentle soul,” said Sheila D’Souza, a long-time neighbor. “He didn’t deserve to go like this.”

The Red Cross is assisting displaced tenants with temporary housing, and city officials urged anyone aware of unsafe housing conditions to report them to 311.

"4 Hong Kong health inspectors acquitted of conspiracy to steal food samples meant for radiation tests.

Four government health inspectors accused of taking food meant for safety tests have been acquitted of conspiracy to steal.

Chan Ying-shan, Lam Hiu-kwan, Yu Fung-chun, and Lee Chun-hei appeared at the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts on Monday morning, after standing trial in April for allegedly conspiring to steal food – including canned abalone, white truffle sauce, and crab bisque – ordered for radiation testing.

The offences were said to have taken place between January 2022 and March 2023. According to the prosecution, the food had been bought by the Centre for Food Safety for testing and, therefore, was the property of the Hong Kong government.

Magistrate Edward Wong ruled that the defendants were not guilty, local media reported. He said the food items found in their homes could have been bought elsewhere, and that the prosecution did not present evidence that those items were samples meant for testing.

He added that Lau Shing-hin, the fifth health inspector charged in the case but testifying for the prosecution, was not a reliable witness.


Lau, who pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of stealing, told police earlier that he took food home because he did not want it to go to waste. He also told the court that he heard his colleagues say before that they brought food home.

Lo Chi-ming, a chief health inspector testifying for the prosecution, said during the trial that the proper way to handle untested food samples was to sprinkle a type of powder on the samples to cause them to spoil before disposal.

According to an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) statement published when the five health inspectors were charged in June last year, they bought food samples worth around HK$88,000 for radiation tests in mid-2022 and early 2023.

A total of 82 food samples were subsequently found at their homes, the ICAC said. The court heard during the trial that Lam had the most items, with 25 food samples found at her home. The food included opened packages of risotto, pasta, and Japanese rice, according to local court news outlet The Witness.

Under Hong Kong’s Theft Ordinance, stealing and conspiring to steal are punishable by up to 10 years in jail, although the maximum sentence meted out by magistrates’ courts is two years.

"4 Hong Kong health inspectors acquitted of conspiracy to steal food samples meant for radiation tests.

HONG KONG – In a landmark ruling, four health inspectors from Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety (CFS) were fully acquitted today of charges of conspiracy to steal food samples designated for radiation testing. The verdict, delivered by District Judge Chan Wai-man, concluded a two-month trial that has captivated public attention and raised questions about the integrity of food safety protocols.

The case, centered on a series of alleged thefts in late 2024, accused the inspectors of stealing high-value seafood samples, including imported king crab and tuna, that were part of a routine testing program for radiation levels. Prosecutors argued that the samples, which had been confiscated at customs, were intentionally diverted from official laboratory channels for personal gain. Evidence presented by the prosecution included log discrepancies and surveillance footage showing the four defendants handling the samples outside of standard procedure.

However, the defense successfully argued that the irregularities were the result of a chaotic and under-resourced system, not criminal intent. Lead defense counsel, Mr. Wong Chi-fai, presented a compelling case detailing overworked staff, insufficient storage facilities, and a lack of clear chain-of-custody guidelines. ""My clients were not conspirators,"" Wong stated outside the courthouse. ""They were simply trying to manage an unmanageable system. The so-called 'stolen' samples were in fact misplaced due to administrative errors, a problem that is endemic within the department.""

In his summation, Judge Chan noted that while the court found ""significant procedural failures"" within the CFS, there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants had a shared intention to commit theft. The judge emphasized that a ""systemic breakdown"" did not constitute a criminal conspiracy. The four inspectors, who have been suspended from duty since their arrest, have not yet commented on their future plans.

The CFS has issued a brief statement acknowledging the verdict and indicating it will conduct a full review of its operational procedures in light of the court’s findings. The case has sparked a wider public debate on the efficiency and transparency of Hong Kong’s food safety regulations, particularly concerning imported goods.

"Mumbai: One killed, several injured in deadly Marathi vs Bhojpuri song dispute at Mira Road New Year party.

Mumbai, India — January 1, 2025

What began as a spirited New Year’s Eve celebration in Mira Road, a bustling suburb of Mumbai, ended in tragedy — and treble — as a heated disagreement over regional music preferences spiraled into a full-blown musical melee, leaving one person dead, several injured, and countless confused.

Authorities confirmed that a cultural clash over which song should ring in 2025 — a traditional Marathi folk anthem or a high-energy Bhojpuri dance track — ignited what experts are now calling “India’s first audio-based civil war.”

The DJ at the party, who goes by the name DJ Remix Singh Saab, told reporters, “I was just doing my job — dropping bangers. Then someone shouted ‘Play Kombdi Palali!’ and another yelled ‘No, Lollypop Lagelu!’ and suddenly I was ducking flying flip-flops and regional pride.”

Party Turns to Panic
According to eyewitnesses, tensions began building after midnight when both the Marathi and Bhojpuri contingents at the party demanded their songs be played next — at full volume and with “emotional authenticity.” One man reportedly threatened to “break the Bluetooth speaker like the British broke India.”

“I was just dancing to celebrate the new year,” said partygoer Anjali D’Souza, still holding a shattered mocktail glass. “Then I saw someone get hit with a decorative coconut. I thought it was part of a traditional ritual until someone screamed, ‘Marathi Manoos never backs down!’ and it all went sideways.”

The conflict escalated when a cousin of the host allegedly tried to mediate by suggesting a mashup. “They tried playing both songs together,” said a neighbor who was eavesdropping from her balcony. “But the speakers couldn’t handle the linguistic intensity. It sounded like a karaoke fistfight.”

Emergency Response and Musical Profiling
Mumbai Police arrived within 20 minutes, equipped with riot gear and a neutral playlist consisting of AR Rahman hits and Kenny G instrumentals. One officer described the scene as “worse than Holi at a housing society AGM.”

Inspector Rajiv Thakkar told reporters, “We tried to calm things down by playing Jai Ho, but even that got politicized within minutes. It’s clear India needs a Ministry of Music Moderation.”

Seven people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from chappal (sandal) trauma to emotional damage caused by the DJ shouting “Last song, I swear!” for the fifth time.

A Nation Reacts
Social media exploded with reactions ranging from outrage to dance tutorials. The hashtag #BattleOfTheBeats began trending globally, with users comparing the incident to other culturally loaded musical standoffs — such as “Despacito vs Classical Flamenco” in Spain, and the 2020 “K-Pop vs Country” showdown in rural Texas.

Meanwhile, Bollywood celebrities offered their condolences. Actor Riteish Deshmukh tweeted, “As someone who loves both Marathi and Bhojpuri songs, I ask — can’t we all just dance to Chikni Chameli and get along?”

Looking Ahead: Musical Tolerance and Aux Cord Justice
Cultural experts warn this may be the beginning of a disturbing trend in India’s diverse party landscape. “Music is meant to unite us,” said Dr. Prabha Kulkarni, a sociologist. “But in India, even playlists come with linguistic landmines. We must learn to coexist — or at least share the aux cord peacefully.”

In response to the incident, authorities are proposing a new regulation requiring all DJs at multicultural events to complete a government-certified “Regional Music Conflict De-escalation” course and carry at least three pan-Indian fallback tracks, including Jai Jai Shivshankar, Tunak Tunak Tun, and the CID theme song.

As Mira Road residents sweep up broken plastic cups and wounded pride, one thing is clear: the fight wasn’t just over songs — it was over identity, heritage, and who gets to yell “once more!” the loudest.

"Mumbai: One killed, several injured in deadly Marathi vs Bhojpuri song dispute at Mira Road New Year party.

A new Year celebration at Mira Road took a deadly turn after a verbal dispute snowballed into a violent attack involving bamboo and iron rods. On Thursday, one person, Raja Periyar, 23, succumbed to injuries sustained during the incident, which was sparked over whether Bhojpuri or Marathi songs ought to have been played, according to the Kashimira police.
The deceased breathed his last at KEM Hospital and the post-mortem will be conducted on Friday. Hundreds of revellers had been dancing to Marathi songs but another group insisted that Bhojpuri numbers be played. ""Since a few of the revellers were inebriated, a verbal dispute broke out. After a few minutes, the crowd got polarised on the subject of regional music,"" said a local source in Mira Road.
Investigating officer WPSI Sheetal Mundhe said, ""The fight started over the selection of songs. We have arrested the prime accused, Ashish Jadhav, and his father Prakash. Other accused, including Prakash's brother Sanjay and Ashish's brother Amit, are yet to be arrested."" ""We have recovered bamboo and blood samples from the crime spot. Further investigations are underway,"" she added.
According to the complainant, Prashant Pandey, 24, the accused and the victim had gathered around Delta Garden near MHADA Colony. ""A group of 10-15 individuals had gathered to ring in the new year. Ashish and Raja had a scuffle regarding the installation of the sound system. We tried to calm Ashish down but he stormed off in anger. In the wee hours of January 1, Ashish came back with some relatives and beat Raja with bamboo and iron rods. Another person, Vipul Rai, was also injured and both were taken to Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli. Raja was later shifted to KEM Hospital,"" he said.
Senior Inspector Lalu Ture of the Kashimira police station said, ""The youths were seriously injured. Initially, an FIR was registered for attempt to murder. But Raja succumbed to the injuries on Thursday."" The accused have been booked under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

Victim's kin

Raja's brother-in-law Dilip Damai, told mid-day that even after the youth was unconscious on the ground, Ashish rained blows on him. ""His skull was badly damaged and he was bleeding profusely. His head was terribly wounded. The post-mortem report will reveal the severity of his injuries,"" said Damai.
""Initially, we rushed him to a local hospital in Mira Road where the doctors referred him to Shatabdi Hospital. Since his health was deteriorating rapidly, we were suggested to take him to KEM Hospital, where he was kept on the ventilator after a few surgeries. But he succumbed to his injuries around 8 am on January 2."" Relatives of the deceased at KEM Hospital told mid-day that Raja was an auto rickshaw driver who lived with his brother and father inMira Road. ""Raja was a very nice man. We are from Nepal but have been living in Mumbai to earn a living.

"Student Housing Plan in Cupertino Sparks Tensions Over Tenant Displacement.

A controversial plan to convert a Cupertino apartment complex into affordable student housing is drawing mixed reactions as local families prepare for forced relocation.

Foothill-De Anza Community College District has finalized its $65.6 million purchase of the McClellan Terrace Apartments, a 94-unit complex at 7918 McClellan Road. The district plans to transform the existing site into 332 below-market student beds. The project is part of the district’s broader strategy to combat housing insecurity among the student population it serves. The purchase and conversion is funded by proceeds of Measure G, a $898 million bond approved by voters in 2020 that earmarked funds for student housing.

But for the families currently living at McClellan Terrace—including many with school-aged children—the project could mean losing their homes.

Tenants have been told they will need to vacate the property by June 2026. The district has committed to providing $3.2 million in relocation assistance, including support in finding comparable local units and covering some moving costs. The district’s relocation plan includes up to $5,250 in rental assistance per household after June, depending on income and housing availability. If no comparable housing is found by next summer, the district may authorize additional funding as a last resort.

Still, many residents are anxious, citing limited availability of similarly priced units in Cupertino’s tight rental market where average rents hover around $3,550 per month, nearly double the national average.

Some tenants say they’ve already encountered bidding wars when trying to secure nearby housing. One current resident said they were told other applicants were offering above asking rent—something they simply can’t afford to match, according to an article in the San Jose Spotlight.

While tenant advocates have raised alarms over displacement, students point to their own housing crisis. According to a recent district survey, nearly 44% of Foothill-De Anza students report housing insecurity. Some commute long distances or couch surf. Others live in unsafe or overcrowded conditions.

The situation has put the City of Cupertino in a difficult position. While city leaders support the creation of affordable student housing, they’ve criticized the district’s decision to pursue the goal at the expense of existing tenants.

In May, the Cupertino City Council voted 3–2 to study alternatives to the sale, including building new housing on district-owned land or converting hotels. Mayor Liang Chao called the loss of McClellan’s “naturally affordable” units—older homes with lower rents—a blow to the community, especially with roughly 60 children living in the complex.

She has since called for greater collaboration between the district’s Board of Trustees and City Council to ensure future land-use decisions reflect community input and transparency.

The San Jose Spotlight article also noted that District leaders defend the decision, noting that the McClellan site was one of few viable paths to new housing.

Students are expected to begin moving into already-vacant units this year.",https://cupertinotoday.com/2025/08/15/student-housing-plan-in-cupertino-sparks-tensions-over-tenant-displacement/,real,0
"Student Housing Plan in Cupertino Sparks Tensions Over Tenant Displacement.

A proposed student housing development in Cupertino has ignited debate over the city’s growing housing needs and fears of displacement for current tenants. The project, aimed at easing the housing shortage for students attending nearby colleges, would convert an existing apartment complex into a larger high-density facility.

Supporters argue the plan addresses an urgent shortage of affordable housing for students, who often commute long distances or live in overcrowded conditions due to skyrocketing Bay Area rents. University representatives have stressed that the project is necessary to keep education accessible and reduce student hardship.

Opponents, however, warn that existing tenants—many of them long-term renters and working-class families—face eviction or steep rent increases if the project moves forward. Advocacy groups have accused city leaders of prioritizing student housing at the expense of vulnerable residents, calling for alternative solutions that do not displace current communities.

City officials are now under pressure to balance the demand for student housing with tenant protections. Cupertino’s planning commission is reviewing impact assessments and weighing options such as relocation assistance, phased development, and requirements for affordable units. Public hearings in recent weeks have drawn heated testimony, with residents split between welcoming new housing supply and fearing the loss of their homes.

The proposal is expected to return to the city council for a vote later this year, with both supporters and critics pledging to continue organizing in what has become one of Cupertino’s most contentious housing debates in recent years.",your task is to create a news article that is closely aligned to the title.

Following extensive inquiries, officers executed simultaneous warrants at addresses in both London and Hertfordshire on 23 April 2025.

Analysis and Context

This case is emblematic of the persistent challenge posed by county lines operations—where predominantly London-based gangs extend into surrounding regions to sell Class A drugs using exploited minors or vulnerable individuals. The coordinated execution of multiple warrants across jurisdictions and the swift charging of suspects underline both the scope of the operation and the police’s determination to disrupt these networks.

The involvement of very young adults—two suspects are just 18 and 20 years old—reflects the alarming trend of early criminal involvement. Addressing such behaviour demands a dual approach: rigorous enforcement and robust support systems for those at risk.","Generate a news article with title: Croydon, Pinner and West Drayton drug deal suspects charged.

"Cavendish Board approves new tax rates.

Homestead property tax rates in Cavendish have increased by about 9% this year, according to data released at a Select Board meeting last Wednesday afternoon. The board held a special meeting to sign off on the new rates.
The homestead rates increased by 25.66 and 23.53 cents per $100 of appraised property value for Fire Districts 1 and 2, respectively. The non-homestead rates — for second home owners, businesses and residents who have not filed as a homestead yet — saw more moderate increases of 6.63 and 4.5 cents, but according to Town Clerk and Treasurer Diane McNamara, this follows a bigger jump that those rates saw last year.

Of course, the actual amount each property will see its taxes change also depends on any improvements to the property in the last year, tax exemptions, specific tax policies and state and local programs, but here are the rates approved by the Select Board for the tax period from July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026:

These rates, given in dollars per $100 of appraised property value, include the municipal tax rate, the education tax rate and the individual fire district rate. The fire district rates are calculated  based on the budget, state land use credits and the Grand List for each district, resulting in two distinct rates that are added to the municipal rate and the education rate at the end of the calculations process.

The municipal tax rate, as McNamara explained following the meeting, pays for the town’s budget and tax-exempt properties. It’s calculated by subtracting expected revenues and state credits and adding tax exemptions to the value of the town budget, then dividing by the Grand List for the entire town.

That rate actually decreased this year from 0.7839 to 0.7697, reflecting a $6,400 decrease in the budget to $2.45 million for fiscal 2026 according to a calculation sheet used by the town.

So what’s driving the quarter-per-hundred-dollar increase in the homestead rates?

The state education tax rate for Cavendish has increased by 14.9% for homestead properties and by 3.5% for non-homestead properties since last year. McNamara suspects this was driven by the large number of property sales during and after the pandemic that sold significantly above their assessed values.

Vermont adjusts its education property taxes for each town based on a measure of how close the sales price of properties is to their assessed values. This is called the Common Level of Appraisal, or CLA, and it’s aimed at making taxes fair across the entire state despite many towns having assessments done at different times while market values change.

Each town is assigned a percentage based on property sales in a three-year period, offset one year from the year with the most recent available data. So, for 2025, the state considered property sales from 2023, 2022 and 2021. The closer the CLA is to 100%, thecloser the assessed value is to the market value. If sales prices of properties are lower than their assessed values, the CLA is higher than 100% and if sales prices are more than their assessed values the CLA is less than 100%

When the state Department of Taxes calculates the education tax rate for each town it divides the school district rate by the CLA for that town. Thus if two towns in the same school district have different CLAs based on sales and how old their most recent assessment is, their tax rates will be different to reflect the actual value of their tax base.

Cavendish’s CLA was over 100% and already falling before 2020, but since 2021, Cavendish’s CLA has been less than 100% and dropping about 10 percentage points per year.

Several other area towns, including Andover, Chester, Ludlow and Mount Holly, have seen a similar trend in their CLAs in the years following 2020. Baltimore’s CLA dipped in 2021 and 2022, but it has since increased following a town-wide reappraisal in 2023.

This year, the CLA isn’t the final number the state uses as a multiplier to determine education property taxes. There’s a Statewide Adjustment factor that’s used to bring the number the state uses to calculate town education property tax rates closer to 100%.

Before adjustment, Cavendish’s CLA this year is 62.10%—the second lowest in the Two Rivers Supervisory Union, with Andover a close second at 62.81%. With this year’s Statewide Adjustment set to 72.36%, Cavendish’s education tax rate was calculated as though the CLA was 85.82%.",https://www.chestertelegraph.org/2025/07/16/cavendish-sets-new-tax-rates/,real,0
"Cavendish Board approves new tax rates.

CAVENDISH — In a decision that is already stirring discussion across the township, the Cavendish Board of Selectmen voted Monday evening to approve a revised schedule of tax rates for the upcoming fiscal year. The move, which aims to balance budget demands and rising infrastructure costs, includes a modest increase in property taxes and updated assessments for commercial zones.

The new rates, approved by a 4-1 vote, will see residential property taxes rise by 2.5%, while commercial properties will be subject to a 3.1% increase. Agricultural landowners and senior homeowners with fixed incomes will remain eligible for exemptions or reductions under existing relief programs.

“We recognize that any tax increase is a burden,” said Board Chair Melissa Raymond during the meeting. “But this adjustment is necessary to maintain essential services, fund school repairs, and address road safety improvements that have been long overdue.”

Residents packed the town hall for the session, voicing a mix of concern and reluctant acceptance. Some expressed support, acknowledging the town’s aging infrastructure and the need for sustainable revenue.

“This isn’t ideal, but I’d rather see our roads fixed and our schools supported than face future cuts,” said local resident Dan Whittaker.

However, others criticized the board for not exploring alternative funding sources. “We’re already struggling with inflation and utility hikes,” said small business owner Clara DeSoto. “A higher commercial tax just makes it harder for us to stay afloat.”

Town officials noted that Cavendish’s rates remain below the county average, and a comparative report released at the meeting showed the town had among the lowest per-capita spending on public maintenance last year.

The new rates will take effect on August 15, with the first installment due by October 1. The board also announced plans for a public forum in September to review potential long-term budget reforms, including possible grant applications and community investment initiatives.

“We’ll continue to listen,” Raymond added. “This is not the end of the conversation—just a step toward financial stability.”

"S.F. punk rock haven Thee Parkside may close under new landlord, owner says.

San Francisco, August 22, 2025 — Thee Parkside, the storied punk-rock bar and concert venue that has anchored Potrero Hill’s gritty music scene for nearly two decades, may face closure under its new landlord, owner Malia Spanyol warns.

Spanyol, who has run the venue since 2007, says she recently learned the building was sold—and is now in escrow—after the longtime owner, Maria Gloria Rando, passed away earlier this year. Her husband, unwilling to manage the property, moved forward with the sale.

Spanyol, who as a long-term tenant had the first right of refusal, attempted to negotiate a purchase. She even found a buyer in the restaurant industry ready to pay the $1.3 million asking price and preserve the venue—but the realtor declined that offer in favor of an unknown bidder who offered approximately $1.33 million. Spanyol was given only two days to match the higher bid and ultimately waived her rights to the property.

Now, with the building’s escrow in progress and the bar’s lease recently expired, Spanyol is awaiting word from the new landlord about Thee Parkside’s future. “This community is fading fast in this city anyway, the people that Parkside has served over the years aren’t around,” she lamented, “If this developer is kind and wants to work with me, that would be ideal. But if they’re dicks, they could kick me out right away.” 

Should Thee Parkside ultimately close, Spanyol says she won’t concede defeat. Her plan is to scout out another “dirtbaggy” corner of the city where the music can keep playing, even if the physical locale shifts.

Why This Matters

Cultural Loss: Thee Parkside isn't just a bar. Over 18 years, it's become a haven for punk, metal, garage, country, and indie scenes, hosting events ranging from “Twang Sundays” to headbanger metal shows.

Gentrification in Action: The sale mirrors a growing trend across San Francisco, where unique, independent venues are being pushed out by rising real estate pressure.

Uncertain Future: With no confirmed plans from the new owner and no lease in place, Thee Parkside’s fate hangs in the balance.

"S.F. punk rock haven Thee Parkside may close under new landlord, owner says.

Thee Parkside, the bar and concert venue that is one of the last vestiges of San Francisco’s punk scene, may have “no future” and could close, according to its owner. Paperwork was signed this week to sell the building housing the 17th Street bar to a developer for nearly $1.33 million. 

The sale comes after the longtime owner of the building at 1600 17th St., Maria Gloria Rando, died earlier this year. Her elderly husband didn’t want to manage the property, according to Thee Parkside’s owner, Malia Spanyol. 

Spanyol, who has run the venue since 2007, said she fought to hold onto the business that came to be known for everything from motorcycle meetups to “Twang Sundays” to headbanger metal shows. As the longtime tenant, she had first rights to buy the lot. 

Though she couldn’t come up with the money, Spanyol found someone in the restaurant industry willing to buy her business and the property for the asking price of $1.3 million and keep it alive. But the realtor wouldn’t consider the bid, Spanyol said, and went with an unknown buyer who offered almost $1.33 million. 

She was given two days to match the new, even higher, number. She couldn’t, and on Tuesday waived her rights to buy the building. She is now waiting to hear from the new landlord about Thee Parkside’s fate. 

Realtor Darwin Tejada did not return requests for comment. The building is currently in escrow, Spanyol said, and the bar’s lease recently ended. 

“This community is fading fast in this city anyway, the people that Parkside has served over the years aren’t around,” Spanyol said, though that doesn’t mean she is ready to give it up. 

“If this developer is kind and wants to work with me, that would be ideal,” said Spanyol. But she expects a demolition of the building, and fears her business of 18 years is likely over — she just doesn’t know how soon. “If they’re dicks, they could kick me out right away.” 

If Thee Parkside does shut, it may not be curtains closed. Spanyol said that, eventually, she’ll seek out another “dirtbaggy” corner of the city to keep the music playing. ",https://missionlocal.org/2025/08/sf-punk-rock-thee-parkside-may-close-new-landlord/,real,0

Thousands of bikers ride in 32nd annual UPMC Health Plan PedalPGH event.

The 32nd annual UPMC Health Plan PedalPGH event drew thousands of bikers from across the region on Sunday, transforming Pittsburgh’s streets into a rolling festival of wheels, music, and community spirit. Riders of all ages and skill levels took part, from families with children in bike trailers to competitive cyclists completing the longest routes.

This year’s PedalPGH featured four route options ranging from a family-friendly 10-mile loop to a challenging 62-mile ride that wove through some of Pittsburgh’s steepest neighborhoods. Streets were closed off in key areas, giving bikers the rare chance to enjoy car-free routes through downtown, the Strip District, and riverfront trails.

Volunteers and local businesses lined the routes, handing out water, snacks, and cheering as riders passed by. Several rest stops doubled as mini-festivals, with live music and food trucks contributing to the celebratory atmosphere.

Organizers emphasized the event’s mission of promoting sustainable transportation and healthy living. “This isn’t just about biking,” one event coordinator said. “It’s about showing how our city can come together around health, community, and the environment.”

Proceeds from PedalPGH will support local nonprofit initiatives aimed at improving bike infrastructure and expanding youth cycling programs in Pittsburgh. Despite morning rain showers, organizers reported record participation and said they are already planning for next year’s ride, which they hope will be the biggest yet.",Write a fake news article with the title ‘Thousands of bikers ride in 32nd annual UPMC Health Plan PedalPGH event,fake,1

"Steelers OL Coach Under Fire After Aaron Rodgers' Comments.

PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers have a young and developing offensive line that has seen it's struggles. But the group, and the team, believe they're headed in the right direction. So does their quarterback, Aaron Rodgers. But after his comments about them, offensive line coach Pat Meyer is catching some heat.

Rodgers made it known this summer that he had to let the Steelers offensive line know they should have a little more fight for those around them. Those comments caught plenty of attention, including some from a former Steelers offensive lineman Trai Essex, who pointed the blame at o-line coach, Meyer.

""It’s good to see that A-Rod spoke up, and I’m glad it got addressed before the season started. You don’t want things like that bleeding into the season,"" Essex said. ""But as an offensive lineman, that’s something that I hope they took to heart. Coach [Pat] Meyer, I hope, heard that loud and clear, because that’s an environment that should’ve been set forth already in that room.""

This isn't the first time the Steelers offensive line has been called out in recent years, but it is one of the firsts for the current group. The starting five is made up of two first-round picks in Broderick Jones and Troy Fautanu, a second-round pick in Zach Frazier, a fourth-round pick in Mason McCormick and then a Super Bowl champion in Isaac Seumalo.

The team has invested well into their big men up front, but Rodgers making it known that they needed a little more grit didn't sit well.

""It’s inbred in offensive-line DNA. You’re supposed to pick up your quarterback,"" Essex said. ""It’s just our nature as offensive linemen to be protective of the guys that are running and carrying and toting the ball.""

Rodgers did make it known that the group has rebounded well and is starting to show that fire. However, Meyer has been under question for some time, and the latest criticism from someone who used to suit up for the black and gold will only add to the heat Meyer has caught in recent years.

"Steelers OL Coach Under Fire After Aaron Rodgers' Comments.

The Pittsburgh Steelers’ offensive line coach has come under intense scrutiny following pointed remarks made by New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The controversy began earlier this week during Rodgers’ regular media session, when he was asked about the challenges of facing Pittsburgh’s defensive front. While initially complimentary of the Steelers’ talent, Rodgers pivoted to criticize the performance and preparation of the team’s offensive line, placing indirect blame on the coaching staff.

“Pittsburgh’s defense is always tough, but it feels like their offensive line isn’t being put in the right position,” Rodgers said. “You can have talented guys, but if they’re not being coached up or developed properly, it shows.” His comments immediately ignited a wave of reactions from analysts, former players, and fans, many of whom interpreted the statement as a direct indictment of the Steelers’ offensive line coach.

The timing of Rodgers’ remarks only amplified the firestorm. The Steelers have struggled offensively through the first few weeks of the season, with quarterback Kenny Pickett frequently under pressure and the run game averaging below league standards. Critics have pointed to missed assignments, poor communication, and lack of physical dominance up front—issues often attributed to coaching.

Social media quickly erupted, with fans debating whether Rodgers was out of line for commenting on another team’s coaching staff. Some argued that his assessment was harsh but accurate, noting the Steelers’ offensive struggles are well-documented. Others defended the coach, pointing out injuries and the relative youth of Pittsburgh’s line as contributing factors.

Within the organization, head coach Mike Tomlin has publicly supported his staff, insisting that improvement is a collective effort. “We all share responsibility for where we are,” Tomlin said. “We’re committed to getting better every week.”

Still, Rodgers’ comments have thrust an already embattled coach into the spotlight, fueling speculation about whether the Steelers may consider adjustments to their coaching approach if the offensive line fails to improve. For now, the team remains focused on upcoming divisional matchups, but the scrutiny surrounding the offensive line coach shows no signs of fading.","Please generate a news article based on this title, including the situation, what happened, the reasons, and anything you think of, with around 350 words.",fake,1
"Seattle heat wave: How hot and for how long?.

Buckle up, Seattle. We’re in for another scorcher as the extreme heat warning enters its third day.

Sunday will see a high of 90 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, the Seattle branch of the National Weather Service predicts. The record high for Aug. 24 is 88 degrees, set in 1982.

The extreme heat warning began on Friday after a high-pressure system moved into the region, and is in effect through 5 a.m. Tuesday.

While it’s not uncommon for the Pacific Northwest to experience various heat spikes throughout the summer, Anna Lindeman, a meteorologist in Seattle, said it’s unusual for them to happen this late in the season.

“This one just happens to be a little bit anomalous because we typically don’t see prolonged periods of 90 degrees this late in the summer,” she said.

The region nearly broke a record high on Saturday, falling short by a degree, Lindeman said. The record high for Aug. 23 is 91, set in 1988, and Sea-Tac reached 90, according to heat records.

Bellingham broke its record high of 81 degrees set in 1966, reaching a record-breaking 83 degrees on Saturday. Olympia also broke heat records, reaching 93 degrees, surpassing its record of 90 degrees set on Aug. 23, 1981.

Temperatures in the region will drop throughout the week. Monday will reach 87, Tuesday 86. Midweek will return to the high 70s and low 80s, the weather service predicts. Wednesday will have a high of 79, and Thursday 80.

"Seattle heat wave: How hot and for how long?.

SEATTLE, WA — August 24, 2025
A sweltering heat wave has settled over the Pacific Northwest, with Seattle bracing for some of the hottest temperatures the region has seen in over a decade. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued an Excessive Heat Warning for King County and surrounding areas, forecasting highs that could reach 99°F (37°C) in some neighborhoods.

How Hot Will It Get?

Forecasters predict that daytime temperatures in Seattle will hover between 94°F and 99°F from Sunday through Wednesday, with overnight lows remaining in the uncomfortable upper 60s to low 70s. While these numbers may not rival the 2021 heat dome that pushed the city past 108°F, the extended duration and lack of nighttime relief are major concerns.

“This is not just a one-day event,” said NWS meteorologist Sarah Delaney. “We're looking at four to five consecutive days of dangerous heat. Urban areas will retain heat into the evenings, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses.”

How Long Will It Last?

The heat wave is expected to peak on Monday and Tuesday, with slightly cooler temperatures arriving late Thursday as a marine push brings some coastal breeze inland. However, experts caution that even then, daytime highs could remain above seasonal averages well into next weekend.

Health and Safety Concerns

Public health officials are urging residents to take precautions:

Stay indoors during peak heat (12–6 PM)

Hydrate frequently, even if not thirsty

Avoid strenuous outdoor activity

Check on vulnerable populations, including seniors and those without access to air conditioning

Seattle’s emergency cooling centers have been activated at community centers, libraries, and select public schools. The city has also extended hours at public pools and splash parks.

What’s Causing This?

This event is driven by a strong high-pressure ridge parked over the Pacific Northwest, trapping heat and blocking cooler marine air from reaching the interior. Climate scientists note that such prolonged heat events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change.

Looking Ahead

If you're hoping for rain or cooler temperatures, you may have to wait. Long-range models suggest a return to more typical summer patterns — with highs in the upper 70s — not arriving until the first week of September.

Stay safe, stay cool, and follow local advisories for updates on the evolving heat situation.","generate a news article for me with the title of ""Seattle heat wave: How hot and for how long?""",fake,1
"How Non-Resident Indians Can Use UPI With Foreign Mobile Numbers.

NEW DELHI - The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has expanded its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) services to accommodate Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) living abroad, allowing them to use UPI with their foreign mobile numbers for seamless digital transactions.
What is UPI?
UPI is India's revolutionary real-time payment system that enables instant money transfers between bank accounts through mobile applications. Since its launch in 2016, UPI has processed over 100 billion transactions, making it one of the world's most successful digital payment platforms.
The system works by creating a unique Virtual Payment Address (VPA) linked to your bank account, eliminating the need to share sensitive banking details during transactions.
New Features for NRIs
Starting this month, NRIs can now register for UPI services using their international mobile numbers, marking a significant shift from the previous requirement of maintaining an Indian phone number.
""This initiative bridges the gap between India and its diaspora, enabling seamless financial connectivity,"" said Priya Sharma, Deputy CEO of NPCI.
Step-by-Step Setup Process
Step 1: Download Compatible Apps
NRIs can use specialized versions of popular UPI apps including PhonePe Global, Paytm International, and the newly launched GooglePay NRI Edition.
Step 2: Verification Process

Enter your foreign mobile number with country code
Provide your Indian bank account details
Upload passport and visa documents for verification
Complete OTP verification through international SMS

Step 3: Link Bank Account
The system now supports linking with over 15 major Indian banks including SBI Global, HDFC NRI Services, and ICICI Bank International.
Step 4: Create UPI PIN
Set up a 6-digit UPI PIN using your debit card details, similar to the domestic process.
Supported Countries and Banks
The service is currently available in 25 countries including:

United States (partnerships with Chase Bank and Wells Fargo for currency conversion)
United Kingdom (integration with Barclays and HSBC)
Canada (Royal Bank of Canada collaboration)
Australia (Commonwealth Bank integration)
UAE (Emirates NBD partnership)
Singapore (DBS Bank support)

Additionally, 18 Indian banks now offer NRI-compatible UPI services, with transaction limits set at ₹2 lakh per day for international users.
Currency Conversion and Fees
The new system includes automatic currency conversion at competitive exchange rates. Transaction fees are capped at 0.5% for international transfers, significantly lower than traditional remittance services.
""We're seeing 40% cost savings compared to conventional money transfer methods,"" noted Rajesh Kumar, a software engineer in Silicon Valley who participated in the beta testing.
Security Features
Enhanced security measures for NRI users include:

Two-factor authentication with both SMS and email verification
Geo-location tracking for suspicious activities
Advanced encryption for international data transmission
24/7 fraud monitoring systems

Impact on Digital Economy
Financial analysts predict this move could boost India's digital payment ecosystem by capturing a larger share of the $100 billion annual NRI remittance market.
The Reserve Bank of India estimates that UPI's international expansion could increase digital transaction volumes by 35% over the next two years.
Future Rollout Plans
NPCI plans to extend services to 15 additional countries by December 2025, including Germany, Japan, and South Korea. Integration with local payment systems in these countries is currently under development.","Generate a fake news article which could be titled: ""How Non-Resident Indians Can Use UPI With Foreign Mobile Numbers"".

"How Non-Resident Indians Can Use UPI With Foreign Mobile Numbers.

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has provided a platform for Indians to send and receive money online quickly and easily. The benefits can also be availed by the Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and foreign nationals, as they can make transactions in India using their foreign mobile numbers. There's no need for an Indian SIM card.

UPI is an instant payment system, developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), that allows users to make payments in seconds.

In 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed access to UPI to foreign nationals and NRIs with NRE (Non-Resident External) or NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) accounts. RBI had also updated its Master Directions on Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs).

On June 25, 2025, IDFC First Bank announced in a press release that NRI customers can make UPI payments using their international mobile numbers, without incurring any charges. ""This facility is available to all IDFC FIRST Bank NRI customers from 12 countries: Australia, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the UAE, the UK, and the USA - for INR-denominated transactions within India,"" the bank said.

The bank noted that NRIs can use the UPI facility even while being abroad, if the payments are for transactions within India. Such transactions do not attract any foreign exchange charges.

The service is also supported by ICICI Bank, offering services for NRIs in 10 countries, including the US, UK, Canada and Australia.

Managing finances without an Indian SIM card is cost-effective as the transactions are made in INR, avoiding foreign exchange fees. The process is also secure as the system has strong security features, including two-factor authentication and UPI PINs.

"‘Razor Blade’ COVID-19 Variant Stratus Spreads In U.S.: See GA Impacts.

The Stratus “razor blade” variant is driving up COVID-19 cases in much of the country, according to new government estimates. In Georgia, case activity is not estimated.

The XFG variant was first detected in January in Southeast Asia, and the earliest U.S. case was in March. In mid-June, XFG comprised 14 cases nationwide, but the NB.1.8.1, or “Nimbus” variant, remained the dominant strain.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s wastewater surveillance data, XFG is now the dominant variant circulating in the United States.

The agency said COVID-19 cases are growing or likely growing in 34 states and remain unchanged in 14. Both the percentage of positive laboratory tests and the number of emergency department visits among people of all ages are increasing.
Here’s a snapshot of activity in Georgia as of Thursday, Aug. 21:
COVID-19 emergency room visits: 0.98 percent (low)
Viral activity in wastewater: Low
The wastewater surveillance data was collected from eight participating water utilities in Georgia.

XFG causes a severe sore throat and hoarseness, hence the “razor blade COVID” nickname. Symptoms common to other variants include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, muscle and body aches, headache, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea.

The variant may be better than others at evading immunity protection, according to experts. Although vaccine guidance is changing, the CDC website still says the COVID-19 vaccine helps protect against “severe illness, hospitalization and death.”",https://patch.com/georgia/atlanta/razor-blade-covid-19-variant-stratus-spreads-u-s-see-ga-impacts,real,0
"‘Razor Blade’ COVID-19 Variant Stratus Spreads In U.S.: See GA Impacts.

Reports of a new COVID-19 variant, dubbed “Stratus,” are raising concerns among public health officials. Unofficially referred to as the “Razor Blade” variant due to its sharp spike in transmissibility, Stratus has been identified in multiple states, with Georgia seeing a notable increase in reported cases.

While early data suggests that the variant does not cause more severe illness than previous strains, its rapid spread is putting a strain on healthcare systems and complicating efforts to control the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is closely monitoring the situation and has urged continued vigilance.

In Georgia, public health officials are working to track the variant's spread and its impact on local communities. While case counts are rising, the state's hospitalizations and ICU admissions have remained manageable. However, experts warn that this could change if the variant continues to spread at its current rate.

“The most important thing people can do is to remain up-to-date on their vaccinations, including boosters,” said Dr. Evelyn Reed, a leading epidemiologist at a Georgia-based research institution. “These vaccines have proven highly effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization, even against new variants.”

Local health departments in Georgia are also emphasizing the importance of other preventative measures, such as wearing high-quality masks in crowded indoor settings and practicing good hand hygiene. They are encouraging residents to get tested if they experience symptoms and to isolate themselves to prevent further spread.",generate the text of an article titled: ‘Razor Blade’ COVID-19 Variant Stratus Spreads In U.S.: See GA Impacts,fake,1
"AI Cameras, Increased Stadium Security Among LCPS Safety Enhancements.

July 27, 2025 | Loudoun County, VA — As the new school year approaches, Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) is rolling out a series of security upgrades across its campuses, including the installation of AI-powered surveillance cameras and heightened security measures at stadiums and event venues.
The initiative is part of the district’s ongoing efforts to bolster safety and maintain a secure environment for students, staff, and visitors. LCPS officials confirmed that these enhancements are the result of months of planning, community input, and collaboration with law enforcement agencies.
AI Surveillance Technology
One of the most notable additions is the integration of artificial intelligence into school security cameras. These advanced systems use machine learning to detect unusual behavior, unauthorized access, and potential threats in real time. LCPS says the AI cameras will be deployed at key entry points, hallways, and common areas throughout several middle and high schools.
“The goal is to proactively identify risks before they escalate,” said Dr. Marcus Warren, Chief Operating Officer for LCPS. “These systems are not just recording footage — they’re analyzing patterns and alerting staff to anomalies, helping us respond more quickly and effectively.”
Increased Stadium Presence
Athletic events are also receiving a security overhaul. Beginning this fall, all major sports venues within LCPS will see increased staffing from security personnel and local law enforcement. Bag checks, metal detectors, and entry protocols are being updated to align with best practices seen at professional and collegiate stadiums.
The district is also expanding its use of ticketing systems with real-time guest tracking, a move designed to reduce bottlenecks and improve accountability at large gatherings.
Community and Parent Support
Parents and community members have expressed support for the changes, citing rising concerns about school safety in recent years. “As a parent, I feel more at ease knowing the district is taking a forward-thinking approach,” said Angela Rios, whose two children attend Broad Run High School. “It’s reassuring to know that the safety of our kids is a top priority.”
Balancing Security and Privacy
While many have welcomed the new technologies, LCPS has also faced questions about student privacy. District officials emphasized that all security measures comply with FERPA and state privacy laws, and that no facial recognition software is being used.
“We’re committed to transparency,” said Dr. Warren. “All data from these systems is securely stored and only accessed when needed for safety investigations.”
Looking Ahead
The safety upgrades are part of a broader district-wide initiative expected to roll out in phases over the next two years. LCPS plans to assess the effectiveness of the current measures through regular audits and feedback from school administrators and the public.
“Creating a safe learning environment is essential,” said LCPS Superintendent Dr. Aaron Spence. “These enhancements reflect our continued investment in both innovation and community well-being.”

"AI Cameras, Increased Stadium Security Among LCPS Safety Enhancements.

Loudoun County Public Schools have contracted with Volt AI to deploy artificial intelligence-powered security cameras throughout the district schools and facilities.

The contract is part of nearly $8 million in security upgrades division Superintendent Aaron Spence included in his budget proposal in January. VOLT was chosen following a pilot program that saw multiple companies compete with each other, according to a VOLT statement.

The system will be integrated into all schools in the county and “will fully integrate VOLT AI's proprietary features, including weapons detection, behavioral analysis, and intelligent alerting,” according to the announcement. These tools are aimed at reducing the number of false alarms and to allow staff to make “faster, better informed decisions in critical moments.”

A spokesperson for VOLT AI said the system does not use facial or vehicle recognition and does not run license plates, nor does it store personally identifiable information.

“After a successful pilot program at Heritage High School, LCPS will be implementing a new AI tool with its security camera systems in all high schools. The software is able to identify potential safety issues, such as fights or weapons, and alert personnel in a fast and efficient manner,” division spokesperson Dan Adams said. He added, “It’s important to note that while AI is a groundbreaking tool, human beings remain at the center of all decision making.”

The cameras are expected to cost around $3 million.

Adams also said the school division has changed its policy to allow only clear bags into the stadiums during high school varsity football games. “This brings us in line with best practices and other school divisions in the area,” Adams said. He added that the division’s Safety and Security personnel will also be testing the use of metal detectors at football games this fall. The pilot program will see the detectors used randomly to “assess their usefulness,” said Adams.

The FY26 budget includes other security additions as well, including panic buttons for staff members to wear in case of emergency. The division also is hiring more school security officers and contracted security personnel.

“While education is our mission and our passion, safety remains our number one priority and we are continuously striving to be proactive in finding the best ways to keep all students, staff and visitors safe at every school and facility,” said Adams.

"Shenzhen Launches China’s First Smart Taxi Platform.

Shenzhen Evening News — On July 24, under the guidance of the Shenzhen Municipal Transportation Bureau, the nation's first smart mobility platform dedicated to the taxi sector — ""SZ Take a Taxi"" — officially launched. The platform was jointly developed by Shenzhen Urban Transport Planning & Design Institute Co., Ltd. (TransUT) and enterprises such as Xihu and Shenzhen Bus Group.

The platform integrates 22,000 cruising taxis across the city and is built around the core concepts of ""network-cruise synergy,"" ""scenario-based intelligent dispatching,"" and ""service upgrades."" It pioneers an innovative model combining online services + cruising taxis + scenario-based interactions. Citizens can access the platform through a WeChat mini-program to enjoy the new services.

Reportedly, the platform has digitized street-hail orders, allowing passengers to complete service ratings, lost item searches, and electronic invoicing directly through the WeChat mini-program. It also supports inputting destinations in advance.

Built on the TransUT TransPaaS platform, the system deeply integrates big data, cloud computing, and AI technologies, reimagining the traditional cruising taxi ecosystem. It effectively addresses pain points of the street-hail model — such as the inability for passengers to track trips, share routes, send destinations, give real-time feedback, or quickly submit complaints.

According to the reporter, the platform targets longstanding issues in the taxi industry with precision. First, it offers a suite of practical features to address passenger concerns, including core functions like “shared driver-passenger view,” “lost & found,” and “service ratings.” The “shared view enables real-time display of destination, route, and estimated arrival time, increasing trip transparency. The “lost & found” feature uses smart recognition and cloud coordination to enhance the efficiency of retrieving lost items.
The “service rating” system creates a closed-loop between passenger feedback and enterprise oversight, driving service improvements.

Second, the platform introduces scenario-based smart applications to help passengers hail taxis more efficiently. By integrating passenger flow data from major transport hubs across Shenzhen, the platform builds an intelligent dispatch system. It analyzes real-time traffic flow and proactively allocates taxi resources, improving hub evacuation and overall operational efficiency.

A platform spokesperson stated that moving forward, the goal is to deepen the integration of ""smart + scenarios"" — not only empowering drivers and enhancing the passenger experience but also helping taxi companies reduce costs and boost efficiency.

"Shenzhen Launches China’s First Smart Taxi Platform.

# Shenzhen Launches China's First Smart Taxi Platform

Shenzhen, China's tech hub, has officially launched the nation's first comprehensive smart taxi platform, marking a revolutionary step in urban transportation. The platform, developed in partnership with local tech giants and the Shenzhen Municipal Transportation Bureau, integrates artificial intelligence, real-time traffic analytics, and automated dispatch systems to create what officials are calling ""the future of urban mobility."" The system went live across all six districts of Shenzhen on Monday, connecting over 15,000 licensed taxi drivers with passengers through a unified digital ecosystem that promises to reduce wait times by up to 60% and optimize route efficiency.

The smart taxi platform employs advanced machine learning algorithms to predict passenger demand patterns, automatically positioning available vehicles in high-traffic areas before peak demand periods. Passengers can book rides through a dedicated mobile app that offers real-time tracking, estimated arrival times accurate to within 90 seconds, and dynamic pricing based on traffic conditions and demand. The system also features voice-activated booking in multiple languages, wheelchair-accessible vehicle requests, and integration with Shenzhen's existing public transportation network, allowing users to seamlessly plan multi-modal journeys. Drivers benefit from an intelligent dispatch system that reduces empty mileage by 35% and provides turn-by-turn navigation optimized for current traffic conditions.

Safety and security features represent a cornerstone of the platform's design, with all vehicles equipped with AI-powered monitoring systems that detect unusual behavior patterns and automatically alert emergency services when necessary. The platform includes facial recognition technology for driver verification, in-vehicle cameras with cloud storage, and a panic button system that instantly connects passengers to emergency responders while simultaneously tracking the vehicle's location. Payment processing is entirely cashless, supporting mobile payments, contactless cards, and cryptocurrency transactions, with all financial data encrypted using blockchain technology to ensure transaction security and transparency.

Early user reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, with the platform achieving a 4.7-star rating from over 50,000 users in its first week of operation. Zhang Wei, a daily commuter from Futian District, praised the platform's reliability, stating that his average wait time has dropped from 12 minutes to just 3 minutes since the launch. However, some elderly residents have expressed concerns about the digital-first approach, prompting the city to announce plans for telephone booking services and simplified app interfaces. Driver feedback has been similarly encouraging, with taxi operator Liu Ming reporting a 40% increase in daily trips and significantly reduced fuel costs due to optimized routing.

The success of Shenzhen's smart taxi platform is expected to serve as a model for other Chinese cities, with Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou already announcing plans to implement similar systems by 2026. The Shenzhen Municipal Government estimates that the platform will reduce urban traffic congestion by 15% within two years and cut transportation-related carbon emissions by 200,000 tons annually. As the platform continues to evolve, developers are working on integrating autonomous vehicle capabilities, with pilot programs for self-driving taxis scheduled to begin in select districts by early 2026, potentially positioning Shenzhen as the global leader in smart urban transportation solutions.","Please write a news article with the title ""Shenzhen Launches China’s First Smart Taxi Platform"".

"HDMC’s energy-efficient streetlight project approved.


Hubballi-Dharwad, Karnataka — In a major step toward sustainable urban infrastructure, the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) has officially approved a large-scale energy-efficient streetlight project aimed at reducing electricity costs and improving public safety across the twin cities.

🌍 Green Push for Urban Lighting

Under the initiative, HDMC plans to replace nearly 45,000 conventional sodium-vapor and CFL streetlights with LED-based smart lighting systems. The move is expected to cut electricity consumption by up to 40–50%, significantly reducing the city’s annual power bills. According to officials, the project is also expected to lower carbon emissions, aligning with both state and national sustainability goals.

📉 Cost Savings and Funding

Municipal Commissioner stated that the project could save HDMC ₹10–12 crore annually in energy costs. The estimated project cost stands at around ₹90 crore, which will be funded through a combination of state government grants, municipal budget allocations, and a public-private partnership (PPP) model.

💡 Smart Features

Unlike traditional systems, the new LED lights will come equipped with:

Centralized remote monitoring for real-time fault detection.

Automatic dimming controls based on time and traffic density.

Longer lifespan bulbs, reducing maintenance overhead.

“Residents have often complained about malfunctioning streetlights and dark stretches in several wards. With smart lighting, we can track failures immediately and ensure quicker response times,” said an HDMC engineer involved in the project.

👥 Community and Safety Benefits

Apart from cost savings, the project is expected to enhance safety in residential areas and major roads by ensuring well-lit streets. Community groups and citizen welfare associations have welcomed the initiative, noting its potential to reduce accidents and deter street crime.

🗓️ Implementation Timeline

The rollout will be conducted in three phases:

Pilot implementation in key commercial areas and arterial roads.

Expansion to residential neighborhoods.

Integration of solar-powered streetlights in selected zones.

The entire project is expected to be completed within 18 months.

✅ A Model for Other Cities

"HDMC’s energy-efficient streetlight project approved.

Hubballi: The Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation's (HDMC) much-anticipated energy efficiency project for streetlights has finally received the official go-ahead. The project was approved on Aug 18 and is seen as a significant step towards sustainable urban development.

Under this ambitious project, existing conventional streetlights across the twin cities will be replaced with energy-efficient LED lights. Additionally, the project includes the implementation of a Centralised Control and Monitoring System (CCMS) to manage the entire streetlight network in real time. The initiative is set to be executed over a concession period of seven years, through a public-private partnership (PPP) model. The govt has sanctioned a total cost of Rs 93.6 crore for the project.

The decision to move forward with this project came after extensive discussions and deliberations spearheaded by the commissioner of the HDMC. The proposal received strong backing from the Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA), which played a crucial role in the decision-making process. After a thorough evaluation of the financial bids, the contract was awarded to the L1 bidder, Tumkuru-based Shri Manju Electricals, who quoted an equated monthly instalment (EMI) of Rs 1.1 crore, inclusive of all applicable taxes.

This project is expected to bring about a transformative change in the city's infrastructure by significantly reducing energy consumption and maintenance costs associated with street lights. The switch to LED technology is anticipated to enhance the quality of street lighting, providing better visibility and safety for residents and commuters. Moreover, the integration of a Centralised Control and Monitoring System will enable real-time monitoring and management of the street lighting network, ensuring optimal performance and quick response to any issues.

The project of installing LEDs was actually a project under Hubballi-Dharwad Smart City Limited (HDSCL), which planned to replace 58,000 streetlights with LEDs. From 2018 to 2022, the HDSCL called for tenders over seven times, but as no one participated, the HDSCL handed over the project to HDMC. The municipal corporation prepared a plan to replace 75,000 streetlights.

SM Ganachari, executive engineer of the electrical department, HDMC, will implement the project within another couple of weeks. ""All formalities with the contractor will be completed soon. Currently, HDMC is paying over Rs 2 crore for electricity bills each month, which will be reduced by Rs 1 crore. Additionally, monthly maintenance costs for streetlights will also be saved. The implementation of this project aligns with the broader goals of promoting energy efficiency and sustainability,"" he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/hdmcs-energy-efficient-streetlight-project-approved/articleshow/123487082.cms,real,0
"BART improves in safety, cleanliness and satisfaction, yet ridership recovery remains slow.

In a shocking turn of events, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) officials announced Monday that the system has become markedly safer, cleaner, and more satisfying to ride — a development that has left many longtime commuters ""deeply unsettled"" and yearning for the good old days of mildly terrifying grime.

According to a new report, BART has seen a 67% drop in onboard sword fights, a record-high 14 functioning escalators, and an unprecedented third car in every train that no longer smells like hot batteries. In what transportation officials called a “major leap forward,” BART now features trains that arrive within mere minutes of their scheduled time — a move that some riders say violates the social contract between the agency and the general public.

“I got on the train and no one was screaming into the void, no one was eating flaming Cheetos off the floor, and the floors were just... dry,” said commuter Luis Mercado, visibly shaken. “I don’t even know how to process that. It’s like the soul of BART has been gentrified.”

Despite these improvements, ridership recovery remains sluggish, with many Bay Area residents refusing to board until conditions return to “normal.”

“BART’s whole thing was that it was a choose-your-own-adventure between mild dread and full-blown existential crisis,” said former rider and nostalgia blogger Denise Fong. “Now it’s just a subway. Boring.”

BART General Manager Bob Powers defended the changes. “We thought if we cleaned the stations, fixed the lighting, and made trains run on time, people would come back,” he said. “But apparently, we underestimated the cultural importance of a man in a cape reciting Shakespeare while defecating in a paper bag.”

In an attempt to address declining ridership, BART has launched a new initiative called “Throwback Thursdays,” where once a week the train system reverts to its 2018 experience, complete with suspicious puddles, mysteriously blinking lights, and a 30% chance of a raccoon sighting.

“Honestly, it’s comforting,” said daily commuter Tara Velasquez, smiling as she clutched a pole slick with an unidentifiable film. “It feels like home again.”

At press time, BART was considering installing AI-generated graffiti, reopening the “Possibly Meth?” car, and reintroducing fare gates that open only if you offer them a riddle, all in a desperate bid to woo back riders nostalgic for a time when chaos reigned and Clorox wipes were a fool’s errand.","Generate a fake news article for the given title.

"BART improves in safety, cleanliness and satisfaction, yet ridership recovery remains slow.

BART’s efforts to lower crime and improve on cleanliness continue to pay off with improvements in ridership and customer satisfaction, according to new figures from the transit agency. However, use of the train system remains about half what it was before it plunged during the COVID-19 pandemic.BART total ridership grew 6.4% in the third fiscal quarter of 2025 from January through March over the same quarter last year, according to the latest BART report. Weekday ridership increased nearly 7% over the same quarter compared to the last year, while weekends had even bigger gains as more families are taking BART to events.

“The increases in ridership we’ve been seeing this year are encouraging and are beating our projections,” said Chris Filippi, communications officer at BART. “Ridership in May was up 5% compared with May ’24 and exceeded our budget expectations by 3%. This increase was primarily driven by surges in weekend ridership.”
The report indicated that the average Saturday in 2025 had a 14% ridership increase, and the average Sunday ridership this year grew by more than 8% compared to the same quarter last year. The Quarterly Performance Review also showed that customer satisfaction is at 84%. Train cleanliness improved by 58% and station cleanliness improved by 52% over last year, Filippi said.​

BART officials credited much of the improvement in ridership and public satisfaction to increased police presence and cleaning efforts.

“The BART Police Department is seeing firsthand the transformation that is taking place at BART thanks to the dedication of our sworn officers, ambassadors, fare inspectors, crisis intervention specialists and community service officers,” said Kevin Franklin, BART’s Chief of Police. “Riding BART today is nothing like what it was during the pandemic. Our new deployment strategies and proactive enforcement provide a more welcoming experience for families in our stations and trains.”

In the latest report, overall robberies decreased from 42 in the previous quarter to 21, while theft of electronics decreased from 43 in the previous quarter to 21. Crimes against persons decreased from 9.6 last quarter to 6.2 crimes per one million trips in the third quarter.​ These gains come as police-related customer service complaints dropped by 63% year over year.

BART is installing new fare gates systemwide as part of its effort to improve the customer experience and overhaul safety. Fare evasion — a longtime challenge for the transit system — has also declined, with reported fare evasion dropping from 24% to 15% over the past year. The upgraded gates, now in 40 stations and set to reach all 50 by the end of 2025, feature advanced locks and sensors better suited to riders with wheelchairs, strollers or luggage.

The report said riders report fewer safety concerns through the BART Watch App.

Reports dropped to 2,398 this quarter, down from 3,166 a year ago. BART recently also placed 400 posters in its train cars targeting unwanted activities such as smoking, harassment and unruly behavior.

Still, overall ridership has grown slowly and remains stubbornly low at about half pre-pandemic levels in 2019. May’s ridership of 4.67 million is barely higher than the 4.44 million in May 2024 and less than half the 10.23 million in May 2019.

That continues to raise questions among critics around the region as transit advocates contemplate a 2026 regional tax measure to prop up BART’s finances as pandemic-era funds dry up.

“I continue to raise questions about whether BART has financially right-sized the agency based on ridership,” said Steve Glazer, a former state senator from the East Bay who has long criticized the agency’s management. “In other words, are they making the tough, hard decisions to align ridership with revenue? If BART is going to go out to taxpayers to ask for money, they need to make a strong case that they have been acting in a fiscally responsible way. The evidence doesn’t necessarily support that.”

Filippi said in response that “we are hopeful that as return-to-office rates rise, BART will continue to see increases in our weekday ridership.”

“Current and former riders have been clear that their safety needs to be our top priority, and we are committed to showing them that we are listening,” Filippi said. “We believe the increased safety presence, installation of Next Generation Fare Gates, increased cleaning, and running only the new Fleet of the Future trains will show everyone that the BART experience has been transformed.”

Phuc Le, a 28-year-old architectural designer living in Fremont, takes BART nearly every day for work and says it’s noticeably improved. Le said he was attacked twice at BART stations. Despite those frightening experiences, he remains a regular BART commuter, encouraged by the recent changes and hoping safety continues to improve.

“There were always homeless people on the train, and even when they sanitized the seats, they still felt dirty,” Le said. “But now, I think they try to improve every day. Sometimes, you still see one or two homeless people, but overall it feels safer.”

Charles Hug, 36, who has lived in Oakland for the past six years and was on his way to the Legion of Honor Museum on Friday, said he appreciates the convenience when he uses BART.

“I enjoy it,” Hug said. “It’s convenient enough during commute hours. When you’re on your commute, it takes forever to wait for a train, but it gets me into the city without the hassle of traffic.”",https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2025/06/29/bart-data-shows-big-improvements-for-riders/,real,0

Uintah Basin Fisheries Among Locations Of New Fishing Records Set In 2024.

The Uintah Basin’s fisheries have been a hotspot for anglers this past year, with several new fishing records set in 2024. The area, known for its pristine lakes and streams, continues to attract both seasoned fishermen and newcomers looking for their next big catch.

Among the top record-breaking locations are Red Fleet Reservoir and the Green River. At Red Fleet, a 13-pound, 8-ounce lake trout was caught, breaking the previous record by nearly two pounds. The Green River saw a new state record for the largest rainbow trout, coming in at 9 pounds, 2 ounces, and a 24-inch long trophy that stunned local fishers.

Experts attribute the record-breaking catches to improved conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and fish stocking programs implemented over the last few years. Local fisheries biologists believe that with the recent increase in fish populations, the area could see even more records set in 2025.

Anglers are reminded to follow all state fishing regulations, including catch limits and fishing seasons, to ensure that future generations can enjoy these waters as much as today’s fishermen do. For those planning their next trip, the Uintah Basin is proving to be a prime destination for trophy fish.",Uintah Basin Fisheries Among Locations Of New Fishing Records Set In 2024,fake,1
"Haryana Man Quits Stable Bank Job To Deliver Milk In An Audi.

A Haryana man has become a local sensation after quitting a stable bank job to deliver milk in a luxury car. Amit Bhadana, from Mohabbatabad village in Faridabad, has turned his passion for high-end bikes and cars into a full-time profession.

After graduation, he secured a steady position at a bank. But Mr Bhadana realised the corporate world was limiting his ability to pursue his passion. He told ETV Bharat that the demands of his bank job prevented him from indulging in his love for vehicles, which upset him.

Coming from a family already involved in the milk business, Mr Bhadana saw an opportunity to merge his love for vehicles with the family's trade. ""I decided to make my passion a profession and fulfil it along with the family business,"" he explained to the outlet. He quit his bank job and began delivering milk to homes on his motorcycle.

To fulfil his dream, Mr Bhadana first bought a Harley-Davidson bike, which allowed him to enjoy his passion while carrying out his work.

The business began to grow rapidly, and as his deliveries expanded, he upgraded his mode of transport. Today, Amit Bhadana delivers milk to his customers in an Audi car worth approximately Rs 1 crore.

His unique story has gone viral, especially on social media. Known as 'The Milkman with a Harley,' Mr Bhadana shared a video of himself delivering milk on his bike, which quickly went viral.

He said he was passionate about his work and was not embarrassed. ""Driving a car is my hobby and I cannot leave my passion. Now I have blended my passion with the family business, due to which I am earning and my hobby is also getting fulfilled,"" he told the outlet.

Mr Bhadana also credited his family's support in helping him continue the business, saying they were proud of him.

Customers who have been purchasing milk from Mr Bhadana for years have been equally impressed with his journey. A long-time customer, who has seen him deliver milk for 13 years, said, ""The only difference is that earlier he used to deliver milk on a bike worth lakhs of rupees, and today he comes in an Audi worth crore rupees.""

In Faridabad, Amit Bhadana's luxury milk delivery service has become a popular topic of conversation, with many locals stopping to take photos and videos of his Audi.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/this-haryana-man-amit-bhadana-quit-his-stable-bank-job-now-delivers-milk-in-an-audi-8276601,real,0
"Haryana Man Quits Stable Bank Job To Deliver Milk In An Audi.

Gurgaon, Haryana – In an unconventional career move that has captured social media attention, 32-year-old Rajesh Kumar traded his desk job at a nationalized bank for the early morning rounds of a milk delivery service, complete with a luxury twist that has left his neighbors both surprised and inspired.

Kumar, who worked as a senior clerk at Punjab National Bank for eight years, made headlines not just for leaving his secure government position, but for conducting his new business from behind the wheel of a gleaming white Audi A4 – a stark contrast to the typical motorcycles and bicycles associated with milk delivery in Indian neighborhoods.

""Everyone thought I had lost my mind,"" Kumar admits with a laugh, standing beside his spotless sedan loaded with fresh milk packets. ""My family was worried, my colleagues couldn't understand it, but I knew this was the right decision for me.""

The decision wasn't made lightly. Kumar explains that years of sitting behind a bank counter had left him feeling unfulfilled and disconnected from meaningful work. When his uncle's dairy business needed support due to health issues, Kumar saw an opportunity to combine family responsibility with entrepreneurial ambition.

""I realized I wanted to build something of my own rather than just processing other people's transactions,"" he said. ""There's dignity in every honest profession, and I found more satisfaction in providing families with fresh milk than I ever did in banking.""

Kumar's premium approach to milk delivery has transformed what many consider a humble profession. He ensures temperature-controlled storage, maintains strict hygiene standards, and offers doorstep service with a smile that has won over customers across three residential sectors in Gurgaon.

""Initially, people were curious about the Audi,"" says Mrs. Priya Sharma, a regular customer. ""But now they appreciate the quality and reliability. He's never missed a delivery, and the milk is always fresh.""

The business model appears to be working. Kumar reports that his monthly earnings now exceed his previous bank salary, and he's expanded from 50 customers to over 300 within six months. He's also employed two assistants and invested in refrigerated storage facilities.

""Success isn't just about the job title or what others think,"" Kumar reflects. ""It's about finding purpose in your work and having the courage to follow your own path.""

His story has resonated widely on social media platforms, with many praising his entrepreneurial spirit and challenging conventional notions about prestigious careers. Local business groups have invited him to speak about his experience, and several other professionals have reached out seeking advice about similar career transitions.

Kumar's long-term vision extends beyond milk delivery. He plans to expand into organic dairy products and eventually establish a farm-to-table dairy cooperative that could serve as a model for rural employment and urban food security.

""This is just the beginning,"" he says confidently. ""When you're passionate about your work, there's no limit to what you can achieve – whether you're in a boardroom or on the streets serving your community.""

For now, Kumar continues his daily routine, starting at 4 AM to ensure fresh deliveries reach his customers by breakfast time, proving that success comes in many forms and sometimes requires the courage to redefine it entirely.","Generate an appropriate news article body for this title: ""Haryana Man Quits Stable Bank Job To Deliver Milk In An Audi""",fake,1

"SUV Overturns After Driver Strikes Parked Car Sunday Morning.

By Staff Reporter | Montgomery County Times
Published: Sunday, July 21, 2025

Montgomery County, MD — A quiet neighborhood was rattled early Sunday morning after an SUV overturned on a residential street following a collision with a parked car, according to county police.

The incident occurred around 7:45 a.m. near the intersection of Georgia Avenue and Plyers Mill Road in the Wheaton area. Witnesses reported hearing a loud crash, followed by the sound of the SUV flipping onto its roof.

Montgomery County Fire and Rescue services responded to the scene within minutes. The driver, an adult male in his 30s, was the sole occupant of the vehicle and was able to exit the overturned SUV on his own before emergency crews arrived.

“He appeared disoriented but conscious,” said neighborhood resident Lisa Tran, who witnessed the aftermath. “It looked like he had just clipped the rear of a parked car and the SUV flipped onto its roof.”

Authorities said the parked vehicle was unoccupied at the time of the crash. The driver of the SUV was evaluated at the scene for non-life-threatening injuries and later transported to Suburban Hospital as a precaution.

Preliminary investigation suggests that speed may have been a contributing factor, though officials have not ruled out impairment. The crash remains under investigation by the Montgomery County Police Department’s Collision Reconstruction Unit.

No other injuries were reported. Both vehicles sustained significant damage and were towed from the scene.","You are writing a local newspaper for montgomery county titled ""SUV Overturns After Driver Strikes Parked Car Sunday Morning""",fake,1

"Special Signs At Sprawling Simsbury Park Can Help Responders Find You.

SIMSBURY, CT — July 23, 2025 — Emergency responders in Simsbury now have a powerful new tool to locate individuals more quickly in the town’s largest park. A series of specially marked signs have been installed throughout the sprawling Simsbury Meadows and surrounding trails, designed to help police, firefighters, and EMTs find people in need of help faster than ever before.

The signs, placed at trail intersections, athletic fields, picnic areas, and key landmarks, feature unique alphanumeric codes. In the event of an emergency, park visitors can simply relay the nearest code to 911 dispatchers, who will use GPS mapping to direct responders precisely to that location.

“We have a beautiful but expansive park system,” said Fire Chief Nicholas Boudreau. “When someone calls for help and says they’re ‘by the big tree’ or ‘somewhere near the river,’ it can take crucial minutes to find them. These signs give us pinpoint accuracy.”

The initiative was a joint effort between the Simsbury Parks & Recreation Department and the town’s emergency services. Officials surveyed the most-trafficked areas and consulted with local first responders to determine optimal sign placement. The project was funded in part by a state grant for public safety enhancements.

Town Manager Maria Capriola said the signs not only increase safety, but also empower residents. “This is about giving the public a tool to help themselves. Whether it’s a hiker with a twisted ankle, a child who gets separated, or a medical emergency, these markers could save lives.”

Each sign is also equipped with a QR code linking to a digital park map, making it easier for visitors to navigate or share their location with friends.

Local residents have responded positively. “I bring my kids here all the time,” said Simsbury parent Jenny Wallace. “Knowing there's a quick way to direct help if something goes wrong gives me peace of mind.”

Simsbury officials plan to evaluate the program’s success and may expand the signage to other large public areas, including Stratton Brook State Park and the Farmington River Trail.

“Every second counts in an emergency,” Chief Boudreau added. “With these signs, we’ve given ourselves — and our community — a valuable head start.”","create a news article with this title ""Special Signs At Sprawling Simsbury Park Can Help Responders Find You""",fake,1
"Special Signs At Sprawling Simsbury Park Can Help Responders Find You.

SIMSBURY, CT — Talcott Mountain State Park is a mountainous and scenic hotspot for those who love the outdoors, with its vast network of trails and breathtaking vistas at the top of the mountain.

But it can be an unforgiving place should you encounter trouble.

Thanks to the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the Simsbury Volunteer Fire Co., there is a way to assist those who could help you should a disaster strike.

With DEEP support, the SVFC has installed numbered sign markers throughout the park's trails.

The SVFC urges those using the trails to keep an eye on them while utilizing them and, should trouble befall you, you can tell dispatchers the number sign you most recently remember or see.

Those signs correspond to maps carried by responders, and they can more quickly come to the aid of an injured or ill person on the trails.

The SVFC last week promoted the signs while also letting the public know about a training exercise July 12.

That's when SVFC members participated in high-angle rope rescue training, sharpening their skills in technical rescues involving steep terrain, the type of terrain common at Talcott Mountain, which is located on Summit Ridge Drive.

""This on-site training at various hazard locations throughout our town takes place several times a year to keep our crews proficient in rope rescue operations,"" wrote the SVFC.

"Concordia Nebraska supports global mission trips with grants.

Seward, NE – Concordia University, Nebraska, a leading institution rooted in its Lutheran heritage, is proud to announce its continued commitment to fostering global mission work by providing grants to students and faculty participating in international mission trips. These grants aim to alleviate financial burdens, making it possible for more individuals to engage in transformative service experiences around the world.

Empowering Students for Global Impact
Concordia Nebraska has a long-standing tradition of encouraging students to step outside their comfort zones and serve communities in need. Through these mission trips, students gain invaluable cross-cultural understanding, develop leadership skills, and deepen their faith by living out the Gospel message. The grants play a crucial role in ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder these vital opportunities.

""Our mission trips are an integral part of the Concordia experience,"" says Rev. Dr. Brian Friedrich, President of Concordia University, Nebraska. ""They provide a unique opportunity for our students to witness the global church, share their talents, and grow in their understanding of God's love for all people. These grants are an investment in their spiritual and personal development, and in the spreading of the Gospel.""

Recent Mission Trip Highlights
In the past year, Concordia Nebraska students and faculty have served in various capacities across the globe. Some recent examples include:

Medical Brigades in Central America: Nursing and pre-med students provided essential healthcare services, conducted health education workshops, and assisted local clinics in underserved communities.

Educational Support in Africa: Education majors assisted in schools, developed teaching materials, and helped train local educators, contributing to sustainable educational initiatives.

Community Development in Southeast Asia: Teams worked alongside local organizations on construction projects, agricultural initiatives, and community outreach programs, fostering long-term relationships and support.

Impact of the Grants
The grants, funded through generous donations from alumni and supporters, cover a portion of travel expenses, accommodation, and project materials. This support allows participants to focus on their service rather than financial worries.

""Receiving the grant made a huge difference for me,"" shares Sarah Johnson, a junior education major who recently returned from a mission trip to Kenya. ""Without it, I wouldn't have been able to afford the trip. It truly opened the door for me to experience something life-changing and to serve God in a new way.""

Concordia Nebraska remains dedicated to its mission of preparing students for lives of service and leadership, both locally and globally. The mission trip grant program is a testament to this commitment, empowering the next generation to make a positive impact on the world.",generate a new article with this title: Concordia Nebraska supports global mission trips with grants,fake,1
"Concordia Nebraska supports global mission trips with grants.

SEWARD, Neb. — Concordia University, Nebraska is offering its students, faculty, and staff the opportunity to engage in international mission trips, supported by two key grants: the Acts 1:8 Students in Mission fund and the Romans 1:16 endowment. These initiatives aim to reduce financial barriers and encourage participation in Gospel outreach and service trips worldwide.

Julie Johnston Hermann, Concordia Nebraska's Director of Global Opportunities, explained the origins of these funds. ""The original Acts 1:8 funding has been around since about 2005. The university applied for a grant from AAL to do mission trips with college students and local Lutheran high school students,"" she said. ""The Romans 1:16 grant came about because a supportive family wanted to provide additional funding for group leaders to lead mission trips for our students.""


The Acts 1:8 fund, which is not endowment-based, supports students by covering up to one-third of their mission trip costs. Since its inception, 143 students have benefited from this fund, participating in 43 different mission experiences across the globe, including countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Ethiopia.

The Romans 1:16 Endowment, established by Dave and Kristi Burmeister, supports faculty and staff leading these trips. Kristi Burmeister recounted the endowment's development, saying, ""The idea to support faculty and staff developed during a casual discussion with then Concordia University, Nebraska President Dr. Brian Friedrich at a St. Louis Cardinals game."" The endowment aims to offset travel expenses for university faculty or staff members organizing or sponsoring a mission or service trip.

From 2014 to 2025, 36 Concordia leaders have received support from the Romans 1:16 Endowment, enabling them to lead students on trips to countries such as Ghana, Belize, and Cambodia. Kristi Burmeister emphasized the importance of these trips, stating, ""Funding from this endowment encourages continued development of mission and service trips by Concordia Nebraska faculty and staff that embolden the university's mission of equipping men and women for lives of learning, service and leadership in the church and world.""

Concordia University, Nebraska, founded in 1894, is a coeducational institution of The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, located in Seward, Nebraska, serving over 1,700 students.",https://foxnebraska.com/news/local/concordia-nebraska-supports-global-mission-trips-with-grants#,real,0
"Florida man impersonates security to get into Taylor Swift concert, arrest report says.

TAMPA, Fla. — Authorities say a Florida man was taken into custody this weekend after allegedly donning counterfeit security attire in an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a sold-out Taylor Swift concert.

According to the arrest report, the suspect, identified as 32-year-old Brandon McAllister of Clearwater, was apprehended after event staff noticed inconsistencies in his uniform. McAllister allegedly presented himself at the venue entrance wearing a neon vest, a laminated badge bearing the word “SECURTY” misspelled, and an earpiece connected to what police later described as a “disconnected phone charger cable.”

Witnesses told investigators the man exuded what one patron described as “unfounded confidence,” striding past ticket holders and briefly instructing others to “move along for safety reasons.” His ruse unraveled when an actual member of the venue’s contracted security team questioned him about his assignment. McAllister allegedly responded that he was “in charge of vibes,” prompting staff to summon law enforcement.

Upon arrest, McAllister reportedly confessed he did not have a ticket but was determined to see the pop icon perform. “This was his strategy to bypass both the cost and the queue,” Tampa police spokesperson Lt. Andrea Morris said at a press briefing. “Unfortunately for him, it did not succeed.”

Swift’s performance continued uninterrupted, though several attendees noted the incident as further evidence of the extraordinary lengths fans will go in pursuit of proximity to the singer. Concert organizers have reiterated their commitment to ensuring a safe environment, adding that authentic security credentials do not include laminated sheets of printer paper or clip-art holograms.

McAllister has been charged with trespassing, impersonating security personnel, and resisting an officer without violence. He was released Sunday on $2,500 bond.

Officials declined to speculate whether McAllister’s scheme was motivated by devotion to Swift’s music, opportunism, or simple miscalculation. The case will be heard in Hillsborough County Court next month.","Based on the title provided below, generate a newspaper article with content matching it.

MIAMI, Fla. (WFLA) — A 44-year-old man was arrested Friday for impersonating a security guard to get into the Taylor Swift concert in Miami, according to an arrest report. Ivan Mariotti, of Key Biscayne, allegedly posed as security, dressed in a blue suit with a gold badge over his neck at Hard Rock Stadium. He was reportedly near the floor and field area. The report said when an officer asked Mariotti why he was wearing a badge, he told them he was hired by four women to work as a security guard, telling officials he worked for multiple security companies. He then told the officer he didn't have tickets, but got in after he escorted ""those ""his four clients"" to their seats. The arrest report said the women told the officer their aunt confirmed to authorities that she had hired a driver for the concert— not a security guard— so they weren't sure why Mariotti had a badge. In the report, Mariotti's occupation is listed as ""Uber driver."" According to court records, Mariotti was arrested on charges of falsely impersonating an officer and interfering with an entertainment event.

"Woman arrested for smuggling cocaine and ecstasy into Bali using sex toy and underwear.

Denpasar, Bali – Indonesian authorities have arrested a foreign woman accused of attempting to smuggle illegal drugs into Bali in an unusual and brazen manner. Customs and narcotics officers at Ngurah Rai International Airport detained the woman after a routine inspection allegedly uncovered cocaine and ecstasy hidden in a sex toy and sewn into her underwear.

Officials reported that the woman, whose identity has not been publicly released pending further investigation, arrived on an international flight and was flagged during baggage screening. When officers conducted a more thorough body search, they discovered packets of powdered cocaine and several ecstasy pills cleverly concealed in intimate apparel and a sex toy in her luggage.

The head of Bali’s Customs Office stated that the case highlights the creative but dangerous methods used by smugglers to evade detection. “We remain vigilant. No matter how unique or unexpected the hiding places, our officers are trained to identify suspicious behavior and perform thorough inspections,” he said.

Following the discovery, the woman was handed over to Bali’s Narcotics Investigation Unit for further questioning. If convicted, she could face Indonesia’s severe drug trafficking laws, which include lengthy prison sentences and, in the most serious cases, the death penalty.

Authorities are now investigating whether the suspect acted alone or as part of a larger smuggling operation. The arrest underscores Indonesia’s zero-tolerance stance on narcotics and serves as a reminder to travelers about the country’s strict drug laws.

Officials have urged the public and tourists to remain aware of these laws and the severe consequences associated with narcotics possession and trafficking. The case remains under investigation, and further details are expected in the coming days.",Generate a news article based on the title of the news: Woman arrested for smuggling cocaine and ecstasy into Bali using sex toy and underwear,fake,1
"Woman arrested for smuggling cocaine and ecstasy into Bali using sex toy and underwear.

A Peruvian woman has been arrested after allegedly trying to smuggle cocaine and ecstasy into Bali hidden inside a sex toy and her underwear.

The 42-year-old woman, identified by authorities only by the initials NS, arrived at the international airport in Bali from Qatar on 12 August, where she was stopped by customs officials.

""The customs officers suspected her behaviour, and after consulting with the police, they did a further check on her,"" Bali police narcotics unit director Radiant, identified by only his first name, said at a press conference.

Upon searching the woman, officers say they found 1.4kg of cocaine and 43 ecstasy pills – worth a combined $70,000 (£52,000) – hidden about her person, including inside a sex toy and in her underwear.

""The narcotics were hidden in six plastic packages wrapped in black duct tape inside a green bra, three similar packages in black underwear, and a sex toy containing drugs, which was inserted into her body,"" Mr Radiant said, according to BBC News.

The Peruvian national told law enforcement said she was hired by a man who she met on dark web in April, and told to transport the drugs into Indonesia. She was promised $20,000 in return, said the officer. The woman took a flight from Barcelona to Indonesia, with a layover at Doha, before arriving in Bali on 12 August.

She has been charged under Indonesia’s stringent narcotics laws and could face a maximum punishment of the death penalty. The southeast Asian nation has some of the world’s harshest laws around drug smuggling.

About 530 people, including 96 foreigners, are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, the latest figures from the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections show.

The country’s last executions, of an Indonesian and three foreigners, were carried out in July 2016.

In 2015, two members of the so-called “Bali nine” group of convicted drug smugglers from Australia were executed by firing squad, after the group were arrested in 2005 attempting to smuggle heroin out of Indonesia.

Earlier this year British man Thomas Parker was sentenced to 10 months in prison in Bali for drug offences, after being arrested for collecting a package that contained 1kg of MDMA.

And last month, three British nationals narrowly avoided the death penalty after they were found guilty of smuggling cocaine disguised as packets of Angel Delight into Indonesia.",https://www.the-independent.com/asia/southeast-asia/bali-drug-smuggling-peru-woman-indonesia-b2810768.html,real,0

"Tukwila Costco murder suspect apprehended in Kenya, extradited to Seattle.

SEATTLE — A 20-year-old man who is accused of fleeing to Africa after killing a woman in the parking lot of a Costco in Tukwila last year has been apprehended and extradited to the United States.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Seattle confirmed Salman S. Haji was taken into custody by the FBI in Kenya.
He is now in the King County Jail in Seattle with a bail set at $5 million.
Haji and his co-defendant, Ilyiss Abdi, 20, are charged with murder, attempted robbery, and robbery for the shooting death of 67-year-old Yuam Ming.
According to the charges, on Jan. 26, 2024, Haji shot and killed Ming while trying to steal her sister's purse as the pair was loading groceries into their car. Abdi is accused of being the getaway driver in a Porsche SUV that was carjacked from a woman earlier in the day in Seattle.
Haji left the country on a flight from the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport five days after the murder. Court filings allege Haji fled Washington immediately after a social media post identified him as a suspect in Ming's murder.
NEW VIDEOS FROM THE INVESTIGATION
Investigators obtained videos they allege show the movements of Haji and Abdi before and after Ming's murder.
According to police, Haji and Abdi carjacked a woman in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood just before 9:00 a.m. on Jan. 26, 2024.
The woman reported she had been rear-ended by a Honda sedan before a man with a gun got out and demanded the keys to her Porsche SUV. The suspects then fled the scene in the Porsche and the Honda.
A Seattle police officer responding to the call spotted vehicles matching the description driving on Mercer Street heading toward I-5.
The officer attempted to stop the Porsche on I-5 in south Seattle, but the SUV fled and the officer lost sight of it.
Just after 10:00 a.m., police allege Haji and Abdi went to a QFC grocery store in Normandy Park and used the credit card of the woman whom they carjacked to purchase gift cards from the store.
The video shows the pair spent around 7 minutes in the store and left the area at 10:17 a.m.
Surveillance cameras then show the Porsche SUV enter the parking lot of the Costco in Tukwila at 10:38 a.m.
According to police, Abdi was driving and Haji was in the passenger seat when they passed Ming and her sister as they were loading groceries into the car.
The Porsche SUV is seen on video flipping around and then stopping at Ming's car.
Investigators allege Haji got out of the Porsche and grabbed the purse of Ming's sister as she got into the driver's seat of her car. Ming was in the passenger seat and reached over to help her sister as she struggled for control of the purse with Haji.
Haji then allegedly shot Ming in the chest, killing her. The video shows the shooting suspect run back to the Porsche SUV, and it flees the area.
Cameras capture witnesses running to a police officer who was already parked at the front of the store and alerting him to the shooting.
The officer responded immediately and called for additional officers. Despite the life-saving efforts of first responders, Ming died from her injuries.
Later in the day, police found the carjacked SUV ditched in the parking lot of a church in Des Moines.
Investigators towed the Porsche to a secure facility and obtained a warrant to search it. According to the report, police found the Porsche’s license plates inside the trunk.
The victim said only the rear plate had been attached to the SUV at the time it was carjacked. Based on witness accounts, investigators theorized the Porsche’s plates had been removed shortly before the murder in Tukwila because it had no visible plate on the rear in the surveillance video.
According to the report, a latent print examiner matched a fingerprint on the license plate to Abdi, while a fingerprint pulled from the passenger side door handle matched Haji.
Next steps in the court cases
While Haji fled the country, police arrested Abdi on May 16 in connection with a separate shooting in Kent. He is being held in the King County Jail with a bail of $6 million for Ming's murder and the Kent shooting.
Abdi has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his next court appearance is scheduled for August.
Haji's next court date has not been set yet, according to the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Haji also faces a federal charge related to the carjacking.",https://komonews.com/news/local/washington-costco-murder-suspect-apprehended-in-kenya-extradited-to-seattle-shooting-killing-shopping-family-woman-yuam-ming-fbi-africa-robbery-porsche-attack-bail-million-theft,real,0
"Tukwila Costco murder suspect apprehended in Kenya, extradited to Seattle.

SEATTLE, WA — A fugitive wanted in connection with a deadly shooting outside a Tukwila Costco has been apprehended in Kenya and extradited back to the United States, authorities confirmed Monday.

The suspect, identified as 29-year-old Malik Thompson, was taken into custody by Kenyan law enforcement in Nairobi last month following a coordinated international investigation involving the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, and Kenyan authorities. Thompson had been on the run since the fatal shooting that occurred on March 12 outside the Costco store on Southcenter Boulevard in Tukwila.

Surveillance footage and witness accounts indicated that the altercation began in the parking lot and escalated quickly. The victim, 34-year-old James Walker, was shot multiple times and pronounced dead at the scene. Tukwila police named Thompson as the prime suspect days later and issued a warrant for his arrest, but by then, he had already fled the country.

“This was a brazen act of violence in a public space that shook the community,” said Tukwila Police Chief Eric Drever. “Thanks to the cooperation of international partners, we were able to locate and apprehend the suspect.”

Thompson was placed on an international wanted list and tracked to Kenya after investigators traced communications and financial records suggesting he had traveled there using a forged passport.

After weeks of negotiation and legal proceedings, Kenyan authorities approved the extradition. Thompson arrived in Seattle under federal escort late Sunday and was booked into the King County Jail early Monday morning.

He faces charges of first-degree murder, unlawful possession of a firearm, and fleeing prosecution. Prosecutors are expected to formally arraign him later this week.

“This case demonstrates that those who try to escape justice will be found — no matter how far they run,” said King County Prosecutor Leesa Manion.

The victim’s family expressed relief at the news of the arrest. “We’ve waited months for this moment,” said Walker’s sister, Monique Walker. “We just want to see justice served.”

If convicted, Thompson could face life in prison without the possibility of parole.","Based on this article title -- ""Tukwila Costco murder suspect apprehended in Kenya, extradited to Seattle"" -- generate a new news article with this same title for me",fake,1
"Danbury's new soccer team Spice City FC prepares for first home match: 'We’re ... a soccer city'.

DANBURY — James Baculima, a new midfielder for Spice City FC, said his “legs are buzzing” ahead of his team’s inaugural home game in front of a possible sellout crowd this Sunday at Danbury Ice Arena. 

Spice City FC, the city’s new Major Arena Soccer League 2 team, will play the first of its six home games at the Danbury Ice Arena on Jan. 12, hosting Baltimore Arsenal. The match will kick off at 3 p.m.

Baculima was among the Spice City FC team members who on Thursday joined team executives as well as Danbury Mayor Roberto Alves and Union Savings Bank President and CEO Chelen Reyes for a news conference. The latter was on hand to celebrate the new season's launch as well as announce a new partnership between the team and the bank.

Spice City owner and general manager Matt Svanda said he is grateful for the new partnership with the bank. The team faced skepticism when it approached other potential sponsors about the endeavor.

“They’ve done so much in the community already. For us to have our founding partner be someone that’s so trusted in the community and has already done so much, it’s a dream come true. The players are excited. The on the field product we’re really excited about. It’s competitive. We have a lot of work ahead of us. It’s a passion project and I’m really grateful for where it’s going,” Svanda said.

Reyes said the bank believes in the team.

“The first time it was brought to our attention that there is an opportunity to do this we jumped on it,” Reyes said. 

“We felt that it was something the bank can support in terms of its alignment in our efforts to continue to support the city of Danbury, where we really look for ways to get communities to come together, families to get together, help local businesses, put the name of Danbury out there and promote our team,"" Reyes said. ""We’re very proud to be part of this effort. We know that it’s not a short term thing for us.”

The team and city leaders have extolled the addition of professional arena soccer as a local entertainment option for the Danbury community, describing it as an affordable, high energy and family friendly sport.

Spice City FC joins a growing number of professional sports teams that call Danbury Ice Arena home. The arena is also the home rink for the Danbury Hat Tricks ice hockey team, which competes in the Federal Prospects Hockey League. In 2024, arena leaders announced that a new arena football team, the Danbury Diesel, will also call Danbury Ice Arena its home turf.

Kyle Liddy, the team’s president of operations, said the journey toward launching the team started 10 months ago. 

“Spice City FC was a dream really,” he said, explaining that team leaders combed the state to find out where would make the most sense as a home base for soccer in the region. “We had feet on the street, just kind of getting a pulse on the city, just seeing how soccer would be appreciated here, and you’re going to see close to a sellout crowd this Sunday at the Danbury Ice Arena with close to 2,500 people here for the first-ever Major Arena Soccer League 2 game in the city of Danbury.

“This city is an amazing place to host a soccer game,” he said. 

Alves is similarly excited.

“I can’t believe it’s been 10 months … I remember the first time we came down here you had a packed house,” Alves said. “... We’ve always been known as a hockey city, but this is a home run because we’re also a soccer city. We’re a sports city. We support our teams.”

Svanda outlined a vision for each Sunday during home games. 

“The dream for me, it truly is [when] Spice City is playing … The drums are out, people are marching to the arena, businesses are excited because they’re going to have more business that day, people buying things, people celebrating, that is my dream down the road. Right here with the ice arena at the center,” Svanda said.

For Baculima, alhough he has been playing professionally for three years, he said he’s always wanted to come back to his home city to play.

So Sunday is the day he’s been waiting for. 

“To come play for Danbury is going to be my dream come true: coming home,” said Baculima, wearing his team’s new gray home jersey.",https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/danbury-ice-arena-hosts-baltimore-soccer-match-20023403.php,real,0

“I can’t wait to see the team take the field,” said local fan Sarah Johnson. “We’ve been waiting for something like this for so long. We have soccer fans here, and we’ve been craving a team to call our own. It’s amazing to see this dream become a reality.”

Spice City FC’s roster features a mix of local talent and experienced players from around the country. The club’s leadership is committed to building a team that reflects both the diversity and spirit of Danbury itself.

Local businesses are already seeing the impact of the team's arrival. Restaurants, bars, and shops in downtown Danbury have introduced special promotions to celebrate the team’s first home game, with some even offering discounts for fans who wear the team's merchandise.

""We’ve seen a boost in business just from the buzz surrounding Spice City FC,"" said Maria Gonzalez, owner of a popular local café. ""People are excited, and it’s great to see the community coming together. It’s a real win for Danbury.”

As the team’s opening match approaches, fans are preparing for a celebration of sport, culture, and community. The match will feature pre-game festivities, including live music, food trucks, and family-friendly activities. Organizers are expecting a packed stadium, with tickets selling out quickly as the home opener draws near.

For Rivera and the Spice City FC team, this weekend’s match is only the beginning. ""We’re not just here to play soccer,” he said. “We’re here to build something lasting, something that will grow with this city. Danbury’s ready for soccer, and we’re ready to give it everything we’ve got.""

"Legislation could resolve concerns with cyber charter school funding in Pennsylvania.

Harrisburg, PA — A new bill introduced in the Pennsylvania General Assembly could bring sweeping changes to how cyber charter schools are funded, addressing long-standing concerns among public school districts, lawmakers, and education advocates about inequities and transparency in the current system.

The proposed legislation, backed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, aims to standardize the tuition rates that school districts pay for students enrolled in cyber charter schools, rather than relying on the widely varying per-pupil costs currently set by local districts. Under the bill, the state would establish a fixed tuition rate for cyber charters, which proponents say would better reflect the actual cost of virtual education and reduce financial strain on traditional public schools.

“For years, districts have been overpaying for cyber charter services,” said Rep. Mary Jo Daley (D-Montgomery), one of the bill’s co-sponsors. “This bill will ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and that students receive quality education regardless of the delivery model.”

School districts across the state have complained that the existing funding formula forces them to divert large portions of their budgets to cyber charters, even though the cost of virtual instruction is typically lower than brick-and-mortar schooling. Critics argue this has created incentives for cyber charter operators to prioritize profits over educational outcomes.

The Pennsylvania Coalition of Public Charter Schools has pushed back, warning that a flat funding model could undercut innovation and student support in the cyber charter sector. “While we support transparency and accountability, any funding changes must ensure we can continue to meet the diverse needs of Pennsylvania families,” said Ana Meyers, the organization’s executive director.

The bill also includes provisions for increased oversight of cyber charter school spending and performance metrics, including a requirement for annual public reports detailing academic achievement, student engagement, and administrative expenses.

Education Secretary Khalid Mumin expressed support for the legislation, calling it a “thoughtful step toward funding fairness” and an opportunity to build a more sustainable and accountable cyber charter system.

The bill is expected to be taken up by the House Education Committee later this month, with lawmakers hopeful that a final vote could occur before the end of the legislative session.

If passed, Pennsylvania would join a growing number of states revisiting how they fund online learning in the wake of expanded virtual education during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Legislation could resolve concerns with cyber charter school funding in Pennsylvania.

Public school districts in Pennsylvania could keep more than $600 million annually under a bill that the state House passed earlier this summer to cap the tuition they pay to cyber charter schools.

House Bill 1500 has been approved by the state House of Representatives, but party politics could tie it up in the state’s Senate. Democrats largely approve the measures, while Republican do not.

The bill, technically amending Public School Code 1949, is part of an effort to boost oversight and rein in funding sent to cyber charter schools. It was voted out of the House’s education committee with a 14-12 vote along party lines, with Democrats voting yes and Republicans voting no.

It was approved by the full House on June 4. Local Republicans Reps. Aaron Bernstine, Marci Mustello, Stephenie Scialabba and Tim Bonner voted against it.

The past couple of months, with schools working on their 2025-26 budgets, have seen administrators and board members speak out on their hope to see state legislators pass reform.

Brian White, Butler Area School District superintendent, emphasized that he, along with other administrators, are not against school choice and parents “having different options,” however, there to be guardrails to make sure cyber schools are funded and perform well, and so the playing field has a level of fairness.

“You’ve heard me at different meetings talk about the unfunded mandates, this is one of the biggest ones,” White said. “If the state is going to authorize cyber charter schools, then they should pay for them. Let them be the ones accountable for it.”

White and others may get a variation of guardrails, depending on what the Senate does with the legislation.

The bill would set a base tuition rate of $8,000 per cyber student. For comparison, Butler paid $18,877 in base cyber charter tuition per student in 2023-24. That rate would be increased for students who have extra needs, such as disabilities.

The measure would also make changes related to transparency, such as the wellness checks and residency requirements.

Other provisions include requirements that cyber charter schools post annual performance assessments online and inform students if they are found to be low-performing, as well as an enrollment cap on cyber charter schools found to be low-performing. Cyber charter schools would also be required to disclose any “entities” helping to finance their capital projects.

Along with the flat tuition rate, there are other financial components. By the end of this year, cyber charter schools would have to pay back a significant portion of their unspent surplus dollars from the 2024-25 fiscal year to the state. That money would go into a state fund for public schools’ capital projects.

The bill would also ban cyber charter schools from saving sizable surpluses which also have raised the concern of public school leaders. Beginning in June 2026, the end of the coming fiscal year, any surplus in excess of 12% of the school’s total expenditures that aren’t earmarked would have to be sent back to public districts.

Cyber charter school leaders have spoken out strongly against the bill.

“If enacted, House Bill 1500 would lead to the eventual closure of public cyber charter schools in Pennsylvania, and 65,000+ students would be stranded without access to an educational environment that meets their needs,” said Eileen Cannistraci, CEO at Insight PA Cyber Charter School, in a statement. “In addition, public cyber charter schools employ thousands of Pennsylvanians including teachers, support staff, counselors, psychologists, nurses, and administrators.

“With the closure of public cyber charter schools, which will be the result of House Bill 1500, massive unemployment will be just one of the consequences of these closures.”

PA Cyber CEO Brian Hayden told the Butler Eagle the proposed $8,000 tuition rate would have negative consequences, and would lead to around a 40% revenue cut for his school.

“We would also like to point out, all of our families are taxpayers, too. We are public schools, with families of Pa. taxpaying residents,” Hayden said. “It is our contention our families should have same benefits of taxpayer dollars as any other families.”

He said he is not opposed to talking about cyber reform, but insists it needs to be fair, transparent, based on facts not perceptions. He does not want his students to be “second class citizens.”

Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman, R-41st, in Armstrong and Indiana counties, said in a statement that “certain aspects” of the bill approved by the state House “could be beneficial.” This includes requirements of cyber schools do wellness checks on students, and of public districts get proof of residency for students for whom they pay tuition.

However, the measure made it through the lower chamber mostly along party lines, 104-98, with two moderate Republicans voting in favor. At this time, it is still in the hands of the state Senate education committee.",https://www.cranberryeagle.com/2025/07/19/legislation-could-resolve-concerns-with-cyber-charter-school-funding-in-pennsylvania/,real,0
"Permanente Creek restoration begins in Cupertino.

After more than a decade in planning, the multi-year Permanente Creek restoration project is underway in the western foothills of Cupertino, one of the first major milestones in the reclamation of the historic Permanente Quarry site.  

Santa Clara County Supervisor Margaret Abe-Koga joined executives from site owner Heidelberg Materials and representatives from the Sierra Club, Loma Prieta Chapter Tuesday for a ribbon cutting ceremony marking the launch of a six-year project to restore 1.7 miles of creek lands.

The plan includes removing legacy mining infrastructure and invasive species, restoring the creek channel site, replanting native vegetation and creating additional pool habitat suitable for fish passage.

“This day was a long time in coming. But I am glad it has finally arrived,” said Supervisor Abe-Koga. “When completed, the project will substantially improve the creek and riparian habitat for fish.”

The plans are the result of Heidelberg Materials’ sustainability team and community advocacy, most notably from the Sierra Club, as well as other contributing agencies including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, SF Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, the County of Santa Clara and the City of Cupertino.

Beyond ecosystem enhancements, the project aims to stabilize creek banks, reduce sedimentation, upgrade habitat for fish and wildlife, and address community expectations for waterway health.

“Our work continues, and we’re committed to staying engaged and responsive over the long-term,” said David Perkins, senior vice president for sustainability and public affairs at Heidelberg Materials North America. “This isn’t just a project milestone—it’s how we intend to work with others: by listening, showing up and building strong partnerships that reflect community values.” ",https://cupertinotoday.com/2025/07/22/permanente-creek-restoration-begins-in-cupertino/,real,0
"Permanente Creek restoration begins in Cupertino.

Efforts to restore a vital natural habitat are now underway in Cupertino, as the Permanente Creek Restoration Project officially began this week. The initiative, led by local government agencies and environmental groups, aims to revitalize the creek’s ecosystem, improve flood protection, and create a more accessible and sustainable green space for the community.

Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, Permanente Creek has long suffered from erosion, sediment buildup, and habitat degradation due to urban development and stormwater runoff. The restoration project seeks to reverse decades of environmental decline by reintroducing native vegetation, reshaping the creek bed, and enhancing water flow through natural engineering methods.

“This project marks a major investment in the ecological health of our region,” said Cupertino Mayor Sheila Mohan at a groundbreaking ceremony held Monday morning. “Restoring Permanente Creek not only helps local wildlife but also strengthens our community’s resilience to flooding and climate change.”

The multi-phase project will span several miles of the creek, with key components including the removal of invasive plant species, construction of wildlife-friendly flood control structures, and the creation of new walking and biking paths for public use. Environmental planners also aim to improve fish migration routes and establish educational signage along the restored corridors.

Local students and volunteers are expected to play a role in the project through clean-up events, planting days, and community science programs. “It’s about reconnecting people with nature,” said project manager Luis Ramirez. “Permanente Creek will once again be a thriving, living stream.”

The restoration is being coordinated by the Santa Clara Valley Water District in partnership with the City of Cupertino and several nonprofit conservation organizations. Funding for the project comes from a combination of local bonds, state environmental grants, and federal resilience initiatives.

Construction is expected to continue into late 2026, with sections of the trail system opening incrementally as work progresses. When completed, officials hope the restored creek will serve as both an environmental showcase and a tranquil retreat within Cupertino’s urban landscape.","Generate a news article based on this news article:

"Permanente Creek restoration begins in Cupertino.

In a major step toward ecological revitalization, the City of Cupertino has officially launched the restoration of Permanente Creek, a vital waterway that winds through the heart of the community and into the San Francisco Bay. The initiative, a collaborative effort between the Santa Clara Valley Water District, local environmental groups, and city officials, aims to improve water quality, enhance wildlife habitats, and reduce flood risks for surrounding neighborhoods.
The restoration project focuses on a 2.5-mile stretch of the creek between Rancho San Antonio Preserve and the I-280 overpass. Work will include removing invasive plant species, stabilizing eroded creek banks, restoring native vegetation, and reestablishing a more natural streamflow. Planners also intend to construct wider floodplains and reconnect the creek to its historic channels where feasible.
“This project represents a huge leap forward in balancing urban infrastructure with environmental stewardship,” said Cupertino Mayor Sheila Mohan at a press conference Tuesday morning. “Restoring Permanente Creek means improving biodiversity, reducing flood hazards, and giving our residents a healthier green space.”
The project comes after years of scientific assessments and public input. Permanente Creek has long been identified as a key tributary with untapped potential for supporting native species such as steelhead trout and western pond turtles, both of which rely on clean, slow-moving waters and shaded riparian zones.
Funding for the estimated $35 million project comes from Measure S, a 2020 bond measure approved by voters to support local water quality and flood protection projects. Construction is expected to occur in multiple phases over the next three years, with key recreational trail improvements slated for late 2026.
Local residents and community groups have voiced strong support for the project. “It’s exciting to see something like this in our backyard,” said longtime resident Marcus Lee, who volunteers with the Friends of Permanente Creek. “We’ve spent decades advocating for this, and now it’s happening.”
During construction, parts of the creek trail may be temporarily closed for safety, but the city promises timely updates and detours. When completed, the restored creek corridor will offer expanded walking and biking paths, new interpretive signage, and safer crossings.

"Dully’s Drop: Foster’s vision for UCLA football identity can be realized with Nico Iamaleava.

Every good team has a personality.

It’s not necessarily the characteristics or traits you would ascribe to a movie character, novel protagonist or real person. More so, it is the tone and connotations that permeate the team, not only describing how the players within the team play but also molding the people in the organization together as well.

The NFL’s AFC North division has always had a smash-mouth, rugged and gritty personality – one defined by battles won in the trenches, games won in the most ugly of fashions and rivalry hatred that runs deep.

The New York Yankees were given the “Bronx Bombers” nickname as far back as the 1920s, characterized by all-time greats Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth and continuing a century later with the likes of Aaron Judge and Alex Rodriguez.

The Showtime Lakers played the game like a poet – articulate, precise and at such a fast pace it almost seemed slow. Magic Johnson orchestrated a seemingly unstoppable fast-break offense and led with such sorcery and enchantment that only LeBron James and Luka Dončić come close to rivaling it.

A team’s personality lasts forever, entrenching its roots during peak harvest and holding them firm through storms until a new flower blooms.

UCLA football’s personality – one of pride, humility and authenticity – took hold under former head coach Terry Donahue’s supervision. As a former Bruin walk-on, Donahue helped breed the foundation the Bruins now stand on – resilience in the face of adversity.

Head coach DeShaun Foster has enriched Donahue’s roots, providing his alma mater with the water and nutrients to thrive while blossoming a new crop. Discipline, respect and enthusiasm are the pillars that keep the Bruins grounded, ensuring proper growth and development.

But when personality is transformed into an identity, the good teams become great.

The Pittsburgh Steelers’ Steel Curtain boasted an identity predicated on toughness and power, manifested in a front seven that would embrace smash-mouth football and haunt opposing offensive lines.

The Seattle Seahawks’ Legion of Boom was no different. Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor were notorious ballhawks who made quarterbacks second-guess every pass they threw.

A team’s personality is something you gameplan, but a squad’s identity is intrinsic to its core.

While the Bruins have established a personality, it seems they lack an identity.

But something seems to be brewing.

There has been a sense of freshness and novelty ever since Foster took the helm. But he has also fostered a desire for vengeance – a chip on the shoulder.

Maybe it has come from years of underperforming or been empowered by seasons of failing to win big games and consistent overshadowing from the Bruins’ rival across the city.

Whatever it is – it is palpable.

You can feel it from the Rose Bowl to Royce Hall, and Foster has no problem showing it. He wants to put his alma mater on the map, to show the Bruins belong in the Big Ten and to illustrate what California football is all about.

Although Foster may be the architect of the Bruins’ revamped program, he lacked a developer – at least until one fell into his lap.

Redshirt sophomore Nico Iamaleava embodies exactly what UCLA football is attempting to embody – proving the naysayers wrong while putting others in their place. It is impossible to talk about Iamaleava’s move to Westwood without mentioning the circumstances of his transfer.
The former Tennessee signal-caller heard every opinion under the sun when he departed Knoxville. And Iamaleava could have fed into the critics and college football aficionados who put a target on his back.

Instead, Iamaleava did what every quality leader does – he stuck to his roots, dug into his identity and found a place that was attempting to foster the same ideals he valued. He never responded to the critics or sank into the shadows; he took up the reins in an entirely new environment.

Iamaleava could tie a perfect bow on his collegiate career with a successful 2025 campaign. But while he may be penning the concluding chapters to his own collegiate story, he is also writing the preamble to the Bruins’ future.

It takes just one year to reemerge from the depths of mediocrity in today’s college football landscape, and Indiana’s 2024-2025 campaign is a perfect example. The program recorded just three winning seasons in the last 20 years prior to last season.

Insert a new coach, offensive coordinator – the same one UCLA now has – and a new face under center, and the Hoosiers won a program-record 11 games and clinched a trip to the College Football Playoff for the first time in school history. Fast-forward a year after the Hoosiers’ historic season, and they garnered their highest-ranked recruiting class in over 20 years.

The Bruins have won five bowl games – two of which were the LA Bowl and the EagleBank Bowl – and produced just three double-digit win seasons in the last 20 years. They desperately need a breakthrough season – like Indiana – to stabilize the program and prevent sinking further into mediocrity.

But change allows for personality to reemerge and identity to take hold.

UCLA made the necessary changes to its roster and coaching staff, and it seems like the Foster culture is redefining its personality. Now, all the program needs to do is win.

Iamaleava is leading the charge, not only for himself, but to readjust the Bruins’ sails, marshaling a new voyage.",https://dailybruin.com/2025/08/23/dullys-drop-fosters-vision-for-ucla-football-identity-can-be-realized-with-nico-iamaleava,real,0

At 8:37 p.m. last night a massive fire was reported in a four story apartment building on Section 2 of Xingnan Road in Zhonghe District, according to New Taipei's fire department official. By the time fire fighters extinguished the blaze an hour later, two bodies were found to be burned beyond recognition, seven were rushed to the hospital where they later perished, and two suffered minor injuries, reported CNA.

The fire had started on the fourth floor of the building, but quickly spread to third floor and fifth floors, with a total of 30 studio apartment rooms installed with wooden partitions. The third floor had five rooms with an area of 15 ping (a ping equals 3.3 square meters) destroyed by the fire, the fourth floor had 12 rooms with 25 ping burned, and the fifth floor, which was an illegal addition, had 13 rooms, 25 ping of which as incinerated by the fire, said fire department officials. Fire department officials also said that the flimsy wooden partitions are a major culprit in the fire's rapid spread.

According to people on the scene, the blaze erupted very suddenly and there were many cries of help coming from the windows, with some even trying to leap from the windows to escape the flames. A bystander watching the scene unfold reportedly shouted to the people trapped inside ""Don't jump, the fire department is coming soon,"" shortly afterwards firefighters arrived with ladders to rescue trapped tenants.

As for the nationalities and identities of the victims, a Taiwanese man in this 60s named Kei Yung-tang (柯永堂), a woman in her 50s of unknown nationality, another unidentified woman of unknown nationality, a man in his 60s of unknown nationality, all died before arrival at Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, while a Taiwanese man in his 50s died after he arrived, according to Liberty Times.

A man in his 50s of unknown nationality and a 42-year-old police officer identified by China Times as Wang Chih-wei (王志偉) both died before arrival to Cardinal Tien Hospital.

There are also two charred bodies that were burned beyond recognition whose names, gender, and nationality are not yet known.

Among the two injured were a 33 year-old-man identified as Tuan Chi-min (段繼敏) of unknown nationality and a male Taiwanese man identified as Huang Ping-ting (黃炳丁), both of whom were taken to Taipei Medical University Shuang Ho Hospital.

The fire is believed to have been deliberately set by a tenant of Burmese nationality during a dispute with another tenant.

The area where to fire occurred is known for having a large Southeast Asian immigrant community.",https://m.dreye.com/WM/196/daily_news_detail_android.php?sdn_id=5328&font_size=,real,0
"NTU upholds zero mark for student initially accused of using AI.

SINGAPORE: Nanyang Technological University (NTU) has upheld the zero mark awarded to a student who was accused of using generative artificial intelligence (AI) in her work. 

The case emerged after the student posted on Reddit on Jun 19 about being penalised for using AI in a final essay for a module because she made citation errors and used a reference organiser. 

After that, NTU convened a panel with AI experts to assess her appeal. She was one of three university students penalised for using the technology.

NTU said on Friday (Jul 18) that the panel identified 14 instances of false citations or data in the submitted essay, noting that non-existent sources were cited and they were not “mere typos”. 

“The panel stipulated that citing non-existent sources is a serious form of academic misconduct as the accurate citation of sources is the foundation of academic research and writing. False citations of this nature are often due to factual inaccuracies generated by generative AI,” said NTU in its statement. 

All cases of academic misconduct are documented in the internal records of the students, the university said. 

“The outcome of the appeal panel is final. We urge everyone to respect the integrity of the appeals process and refrain from making personal attacks against any individual involved.” 

Responding to questions from CNA about the outcome of her appeal, the student, who requested to remain anonymous, said the school confirmed to her that she was given a zero mark because of the mistakes in her essay, rather than for the use of AI. 

“Their entire talk with me during the meeting was on how I can avoid making essay mistakes in the future, didn’t tackle AI usage at all,” she told CNA. 

According to the student, the zero mark was upheld because of the professor’s standards around writing. While she was reassured that there will be no permanent record, she still felt the situation was unfair. 

“I’m just upset that there’s no AI found so the goalpost shifted from AI to my writing standard,” she said. 

The student had admitted to using a reference organiser, which is a tool that collects and organises references and citations. She found the alphabetical order sorter online when she searched “citation sorter A-Z”. 

“They didn’t bring up my citation sorter at all, which was initially one of the things I was penalised for,” she told CNA. 

As part of her appeal, she provided proof of her writing process. She paid for Draftback, a Google Chrome extension that records keystrokes, to retroactively show that she typed her essay out by hand instead of copying and pasting it from ChatGPT. 

When asked about the mistakes and why the school may have said they were not “mere typos”, the student declined to share a full list of the 14 mistakes because she was not sure if the document is confidential. 

Addressing the non-existent sources, she added: “It’s only non-existent because of the typos. And frankly writing citations wrongly is quite common amongst undergraduates. I just got unlucky.” 

She shared some examples of her mistakes – misspelling an author’s last name as Lee instead of Li and two instances of getting the citation date wrong. 

“Frankly speaking I’m too tired to fight any further and exhausted all my avenues. So I think I’ll just move on, at least I know in my heart I didn’t use AI and they couldn’t prove it,” she said. ",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ntu-ai-reddit-post-zero-mark-appeal-5245671,real,0
"NTU upholds zero mark for student initially accused of using AI.

SINGAPORE – August 22, 2025 – Nanyang Technological University (NTU) has upheld a penalty of zero marks for a final-year assignment submitted by a student from its School of Humanities, ending a weeks-long appeals process that has ignited debate on campus about the role of artificial intelligence in education.

The case involves a fourth-year student who was flagged for the potential use of generative AI in a major term paper. While the university’s disciplinary board acknowledged the ambiguity in proving that the essay was entirely AI-generated, it ultimately stood by the zero-grade penalty, citing a different but related breach of academic integrity: the student's failure to declare the use of AI tools for any part of the research and writing process.

The incident began last month when a professor's plagiarism and AI-detection software flagged the student's 3,000-word essay with a high probability of AI authorship. The student, who has requested to remain anonymous, was immediately given a failing grade for the module pending an investigation.

During the appeal, the student vehemently denied using AI to write the essay from scratch. However, they admitted to using a popular AI platform for brainstorming initial ideas, summarizing dense academic journals, and refining sentence structure and grammar.

""I used it as a tool, just like I would use a grammar checker or a library search engine,"" the student stated in a written appeal shared with the student union. ""The core arguments, the research, and the critical analysis were all my own. The policy was unclear on whether this level of assistance needed to be cited.""

NTU's final verdict, delivered this week, pivoted away from the initial accusation of outright AI authorship. In a statement, a university spokesperson said, ""NTU is committed to fostering academic integrity while embracing technological advancements. Our updated academic guidelines, effective from the start of this academic year, explicitly require students to declare any and all use of generative AI tools in their submissions. The investigation concluded that the student failed to adhere to this disclosure requirement.""

The university's policy, revised in early 2025, requires students to include an ""AI Usage Declaration"" appendix in their assignments, detailing which tools were used and for what purpose. This policy was designed to create transparency and distinguish between permissible AI-assisted work and outright academic dishonesty.

The decision has sent ripples across the student body. Some argue the penalty is disproportionately harsh for what amounts to a citation error, especially as students are still adapting to the new AI-related policies. Others support the university's firm stance, arguing that clear rules are necessary to maintain academic standards in the age of AI.

Dr. Aisha Ibrahim, an education policy analyst, commented that the case highlights a critical shift in how universities are managing AI. ""The battle has moved from detection to declaration,"" Dr. Ibrahim said. ""AI detection tools are notoriously unreliable. By focusing on mandatory disclosure, universities are placing the onus of transparency on the student. This NTU case will likely serve as a precedent, emphasizing that in academia today, failing to cite your AI tool can be as serious as failing to cite a human author.""

The student will not be expelled but will have to retake the module to fulfill their graduation requirements. The case serves as a stark reminder to students across Singapore of the evolving rules of academic engagement and the critical importance of transparently acknowledging the role of AI in their work.","Generate a news article with the title ""NTU upholds zero mark for student initially accused of using AI"".

"Wanted Bihar gangster gunned down in Hapur encounter.

A wanted gangster facing several cases in Bihar was gunned down in a police encounter in Uttar Pradesh’s Hapur district in the early hours of Monday, officials said.

The shootout took place in the Simbhaoli police station area, where a police team intercepted Dabloo Yadav after receiving a tip-off about his movement. The operation was carried out jointly by the Uttar Pradesh Police’s Special Task Force (STF) and the Bihar Police.

Yadav, a native of Sahebpur Kamal area of Begusarai in Bihar, was carrying a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head. He had been absconding for several months after a case was registered against him in connection with the kidnapping and murder of a local Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) leader. He was also a key suspect in several other heinous crimes registered across Bihar.

UP STF Additional Director General (ADG) Amitabh Yash said Yadav opened fire on the police team, which retaliated in defence. The gangster sustained a gunshot injury to his chest and was rushed to a hospital, where he succumbed to injuries, he said.

The police said apart from the HAM leader’s kidnapping and murder, at least 24 other cases — including that of murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping, and violations of the Arms Act, were registered against Yadav at several police stations in Bihar.

The Bihar Police said, “Yadav was on the run for some time. Acting on intelligence inputs, our team reached UP and coordinated with the STF. During the encounter, Yadav was killed in the retaliatory firing.”

A large number of firearms, cartridges, and other items were seized, ADG Yash said.

On May 24, 2025, Yadav, with the help of his gang, allegedly kidnapped Vikash Kumar alias Rakesh Kadam, the block president of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM party) from the Sahebpur Kamal area and took him to the riverine region where he was killed and buried under sand to conceal the body, the STF added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/wanted-bihar-gangster-gunned-down-in-hapur-encounter-10155488/,real,0
"Wanted Bihar gangster gunned down in Hapur encounter.

HAPUR, July 29 – A notorious Bihar-based gangster carrying a bounty of ₹2 lakh was killed in an encounter with Uttar Pradesh Police in Hapur district early Tuesday morning, bringing an end to a month-long manhunt that had stretched across three states.

Rajesh Kumar Singh, 34, wanted in multiple murder and extortion cases in Bihar, was gunned down around 4:30 AM during a police operation in the Garh Road area of Hapur. The encounter occurred when Singh and two associates opened fire on a joint team of UP STF (Special Task Force) and local police who had surrounded their hideout based on intelligence inputs.

""The accused was wanted in seven criminal cases including three murders, kidnapping, and extortion in Bihar's Begusarai and Patna districts,"" said Hapur Superintendent of Police Deepak Bhuker. ""He had been on the run since June 15 after escaping from police custody during a court hearing in Patna.""

The operation was launched after police received a tip-off about Singh's presence in a rented accommodation near the Delhi-Meerut highway. Two of Singh's accomplices, identified as Mukesh Yadav and Sanjay Kumar, both from Bihar, were arrested during the encounter. One police constable sustained minor injuries from splinter wounds.

Local resident Ramesh Gupta, who lives near the encounter site, said he was woken by gunfire around dawn. ""There were continuous sounds of firing for about 15 minutes. We were scared and stayed inside our homes until police gave the all-clear,"" Gupta told reporters.

Singh was allegedly the leader of a criminal gang that operated primarily in eastern Bihar and had recently expanded operations to Delhi and western UP. Police recovered a country-made pistol, 12 live cartridges, and ₹45,000 in cash from the encounter site.

""This was a significant breakthrough as Singh was involved in a protection racket targeting local businessmen and contractors,"" explained Additional SP (Rural) Vineet Bhatnagar. ""His elimination will provide relief to traders who were being extorted across the region.""

The Bihar Police had announced a ₹2 lakh reward for information leading to Singh's arrest. He was also wanted in connection with the murder of a local panchayat leader in Begusarai district last month, which had sparked protests and demands for swift action against criminal gangs.

This encounter marks the third major anti-crime operation conducted by UP Police in the Delhi NCR region this month, as authorities intensify efforts to crack down on interstate criminal networks. The bodies and arrested suspects have been sent for medical examination and legal proceedings, respectively.

Police officials indicated that investigation into Singh's network would continue, with efforts underway to apprehend other gang members still at large.","Write a full local news article based on the following headline.

"Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis can continue High Court libel claim over 'smear campaign'.

Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis has been granted permission to proceed with his High Court libel claim concerning allegations of a ""smear campaign"" against him. The claim centers on accusations that Marinakis, who also owns Olympiacos FC, was unfairly targeted through defamatory statements that he asserts have damaged his reputation.

The case involves allegations that surfaced in various publications, painting Marinakis in a negative light. These allegations, he claims, were not only false but part of a coordinated effort to tarnish his image. Marinakis has consistently denied the accusations, maintaining his innocence and calling for accountability from those who propagated the claims.

In a statement, representatives for Marinakis emphasized his commitment to clearing his name and exposing what he believes to be an orchestrated campaign against him. They expressed confidence in the judicial process, underscoring Marinakis’s reputation as a successful businessman and football club owner.

The High Court's decision to allow the claim to proceed is a significant step in what is expected to be a closely watched legal battle. It highlights the ongoing challenges public figures face in protecting their reputations while navigating the intense scrutiny of their professional and personal lives.

The outcome of the case could have broader implications, particularly in the realm of media accountability and the balance between free speech and defamation. Marinakis, who has played a pivotal role in Nottingham Forest’s recent resurgence, has vowed to fight the allegations vigorously.

As the case moves forward, it is likely to draw attention not only from football fans but also from legal and media circles keen to understand the implications of this high-profile dispute.","Please write a news for me, here is the title: Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis can continue High Court libel claim over 'smear campaign'",fake,1
"Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis can continue High Court libel claim over 'smear campaign'.

Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis can continue a libel claim against a Greek football rival at the High Court, a judge has ruled. Mr Marinakis, who also owns Greek side Olympiacos, sued Irini Karipidis, the owner of Super League rivals Aris, over several “false” allegations including that he had conducted match-fixing and was involved in a high-profile drug trafficking case in Greece, which he denies.

Barristers for the shipping magnate told a hearing in October that the £2.1 million claim should be allowed to continue in an English court, and that the allegations amounted to a “smear campaign”. Lawyers for Ms Karipidis said that an English court “is not clearly the most appropriate place” for the claim, which “lacks merit”.
In a judgment on Friday (January 10), Richard Spearman KC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, said: “Leaving aside altogether that this is ultimately an issue for trial on the evidence that will by then be available, the gravity of the allegations complained of and the nature and extent of each publication pleaded is such that, in my judgment, on the materials at present before the court, an inference of ‘serious harm’ appears hard to resist.”

He continued: “If the claimant’s pleaded case succeeds, the level of general damages to which he would, on the face of it, be entitled is such that, from the perspective of compensating for harm to his reputation alone, the claim seems well worth bringing, to say nothing of compensation for distress or the element of vindication which is typically of significance in claims for defamation.”
The previous hearing in London was told that the allegations, which Mr Marinakis denies, were made on a website, social media, and mobile billboards between November 2023 and March last year. The court was told that the website was called “nottinghamforestfire.co.uk”, with three articles published online in November 2023.

An account was also created on X, formerly Twitter, with several posts published in December 2023, and six videos uploaded to a YouTube channel. The allegations were also displayed on mobile billboards driven around Nottingham Forest’s stadium, the City Ground, on two match days.
The YouTube channel, X account and website were all later taken down. David Sherborne, for Mr Marinakis, told the court in written submissions that the “highly defamatory” allegations were “completely untrue”.

He said they included that Mr Marinakis was a “leader of a criminal organisation” and “guilty of match-fixing practices including extortion, fraud and arson”, among others. He added that an English court could hear the claim as “the methods and the objective (the defendants) devised and pursued for their campaign were all quintessentially English”.
Matthew Hodson, for Ms Karipidis, told the court that the social media campaign had “limited publication” and “fared pathetically”, and that there was no evidence of “actual harm” to Mr Marinakis’s reputation.

He continued that the dispute stemmed from an incident at a match between Olympiacos and Aris, which Ms Karipidis runs with her brother, Theodoros. It was claimed that in the 2022-23 season, Mr Marinakis approached Mr Karipidis to fix a “critical” game between the teams so that Olympiacos would win.
Mr Karipidis refused and the game ended 2-2, with Olympiacos – who had won the league in the previous three seasons – finishing the season in third place. Mr Hodson said: “During the game, Mr Marinakis became so angry that, according to Ms Karipidis, he threatened that Theodoros ‘would not leave the field alive’ if Olympiacos lost.

“At the end of the game, Mr Marinakis then told Theodoros, ‘you are finished’ and ‘I will destroy you’. Thereafter, Mr Marinakis began a campaign of intimidation and interference with the lives and businesses of Ms Karipidis and her brother.”

He continued the claim is “wholly unexplained if not as revenge for the Aris (versus) Olympiacos game” and that the damages sought were “utterly disproportionate”. A further hearing in the case is now expected to be held at a later date.",https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/nottingham-forest-owner-evangelos-marinakis-9853771,real,0
"Cedar Race 1st Jebbeh Event.

Jebbeh, July 22, 2025 — The small yet vibrant town of Jebbeh witnessed a historic moment this past weekend as it hosted the very first Cedar Race, a heart-pounding athletic event that brought together runners, families, and spectators in a celebration of unity, health, and community pride.

Billed as the “Cedar Race 1st Jebbeh Event,” the race drew more than 400 participants from across the region — from seasoned marathoners to enthusiastic first-time runners. With a scenic route winding through cedar-covered hills, ancient village paths, and breathtaking mountain views, the race wasn't just a physical challenge — it was a soul-stirring journey.

A Celebration of Spirit and Scenery

As the morning sun rose over the cedar trees, the energy in Jebbeh was electric. Music filled the air, children waved handmade flags, and volunteers lined the course with water, cheers, and smiles. For many locals, it was more than a race — it was a long-awaited dream finally brought to life.

“This is a proud day for Jebbeh,” said Mayor Hani Darwish, addressing the crowd during the opening ceremony. “We are showcasing our town’s beauty, strength, and hospitality to the world.”

Winners, Cheers, and Firsts

In the men’s division, Ali Kamal, a 24-year-old athlete from Tripoli, crossed the finish line first with a time of 41 minutes. In the women’s division, Maya Saba, a teacher and mother of two from nearby Ehden, won hearts as she claimed first place with a radiant smile and a time of 46 minutes.

“I ran for my kids,” Maya shared, wiping away joyful tears. “I wanted to show them that with heart, anything is possible.”

More Than a Race

Beyond the competition, the event featured a vibrant festival atmosphere, complete with food stalls, local artisans, traditional music, and kids’ activities. It was clear this wasn’t just about running — it was about connection, culture, and celebration.

Organizers from the Cedar Sports Collective said they hope to make the race an annual tradition. “This is just the beginning,” said coordinator Rania Haddad. “Jebbeh has opened its arms, and the world has responded with love.”

Looking Ahead

As the sun set behind the mountains and the last runners were welcomed with roaring applause, one thing was certain — the Cedar Race 1st Jebbeh Event wasn’t just a race. It was a memory in the making, a powerful symbol of what small communities can achieve when they come together with passion and purpose.","generate a new article using this title:

"2 dead, 10 missing after colossal rain in China’s Shandong.

Heavy rain in China’s eastern province of Shandong killed two people and left 10 people missing after half a year’s worth of rain fell in five hours, drenching the Laiwu district in the city of Jinan, the local government reported on July 22.

The area saw maximum precipitation of 364mm that fell on July 22 from midnight to 5am local time, which is about half of Jinan’s average yearly precipitation of 733mm.

Flash floods occurred near Jinan’s mountainous villages of Shiwuzi and Zhujiayu, washing away or damaging 19 houses.

Rescue operations are under way and all efforts were being deployed to rescue missing people, the authorities said.

The deluge is part of a broader pattern of extreme weather across the country due to the East Asia monsoon which has caused disruptions in the world’s second-largest economy.

Southern regions have also been inundated with heavy rain after Typhoon Wipha pounded Hong Kong on July 20.

Extreme rainfall and severe flooding, which meteorologists link to climate change, increasingly pose major challenges as they threaten to overwhelm ageing flood defences, displace millions and wreak havoc on a US$2.8 trillion (S$3.6 trillion) agricultural sector. REUTERS

"2 dead, 10 missing after colossal rain in China’s Shandong.

Heavy rains lashed China’s eastern Shandong province over the weekend, unleashing widespread flooding that has claimed at least two lives and left ten more unaccounted for. Meteorological stations recorded more than 200 mm of rain in under 24 hours—the highest single‑day total in the region since records began—swelling rivers and inundating low‑lying towns across the province’s western prefectures.

Local authorities report that two residents were swept away when floodwaters breached riverbanks in Pingyi County early Sunday morning. Rescue teams mobilized more than 500 personnel, including firefighters, paramedics, and members of the People’s Armed Police, who have been using inflatable boats and high‑water vehicles to evacuate trapped villagers. To date, ten individuals remain missing—most believed to be farmers caught unawares by the sudden rise of the Yellow River’s tributaries—while over 3,000 households have been relocated to temporary shelters.

Provincial governor Li Ming issued an emergency decree, dispatching additional resources and ordering inspections of key dams and levees. Schools and nonessential businesses in the hardest‑hit areas have been closed, and the provincial meteorological bureau has warned of continued thunderstorms through midweek. Relief workers are distributing food, clean water, and medical supplies to displaced families, while engineers work around the clock to reinforce flood defenses ahead of the next forecasted downpour. Authorities emphasize that residents should stay vigilant and heed evacuation orders as Shandong confronts the aftermath of this “once‑in‑a‑decade” deluge.","generate an article without searching online for this title ""2 dead, 10 missing after colossal rain in China’s Shandong""",fake,1
"Pittsburgh City Council approves Bakery Square expansion.

Pittsburgh City Council on Tuesday approved legislation that paves the way for a massive expansion of the Bakery Square development in the city’s East End.

"Pittsburgh City Council approves Bakery Square expansion.

PITTSBURGH, PA — July 22, 2025 — The Pittsburgh City Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to approve a major expansion of Bakery Square, the vibrant mixed-use development in the city’s East End. The project, spearheaded by Walnut Capital, is set to add new office spaces, residential units, and green areas aimed at further revitalizing the neighborhood.

The $150 million expansion plan includes two new office buildings, a 200-unit apartment complex, and a pedestrian-friendly plaza that will connect existing structures with the new additions. The development will also feature a 1.5-acre public park, part of Walnut Capital’s commitment to incorporating more community spaces in its projects.

“Bakery Square has been a cornerstone of Pittsburgh’s innovation economy,” said Mayor Ed Gainey in a statement following the council’s vote. “This expansion represents an investment not just in economic growth but in making our neighborhoods more livable, walkable, and sustainable.”

City officials noted that the project is expected to generate over 500 construction jobs and create more than 1,000 permanent positions once completed. The expansion will also include sustainability-focused design elements, such as energy-efficient buildings and stormwater management systems.

Despite concerns from some local residents about increased traffic and rising housing costs in the area, the plan gained broad support due to its economic potential and emphasis on community engagement. Walnut Capital pledged to allocate funds toward affordable housing initiatives in nearby neighborhoods as part of the agreement.

“We want Bakery Square to remain a place where people live, work, and gather,” said Todd Reidbord, president of Walnut Capital. “This expansion is designed with both economic vitality and community needs in mind.”

Construction is expected to begin in early 2026, with the first phase scheduled to open in late 2027.","Generate a news article with the following title: ""Pittsburgh City Council approves Bakery Square expansion""",fake,1

"Pittsburgh City Council approves Bakery Square expansion.

By Jane Thompson, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review
July 22, 2025 – East Liberty

PITTSBURGH — In a 7–2 vote last night, Pittsburgh City Council gave final approval to a major expansion of the Bakery Square development in the East Liberty neighborhood, greenlighting roughly $120 million in new construction that aims to add residential units, office space and community amenities over the next four years.

A mixed-use vision grows
Developer Walnut Capital unveiled plans in March to extend the popular mixed-use complex eastward along Penn Avenue, filling a half-block of vacant land with:
	•	200 apartment units, including 20 percent reserved as affordable housing;
	•	100,000 square feet of Class A office space designed for tech and life-science firms;
	•	20,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and restaurants;
	•	A 5,000-square-foot public plaza with outdoor seating, art installations and a seasonal market pavilion.

“The expanded Bakery Square will be a true neighborhood centerpiece, connecting people to jobs, amenities and each other,” said Jim Russin, Walnut Capital’s vice president of development. “We’ve listened closely to residents’ feedback on parking, streetscape design and affordability, and we believe this plan strikes the right balance.”

Council deliberates community concerns
Councilman Anthony Coghill (District 8), whose district includes East Liberty, praised the project’s potential economic boost but voiced reservations about traffic impacts. “East Liberty streets are already congested during rush hour,” Coghill said. “I’m pleased Walnut Capital has committed to funding traffic signal upgrades and adding on-site parking, but we’ll need strict monitoring to ensure those measures work.”

Councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith (District 9) echoed those concerns, noting that during public hearings held in May, neighbors raised questions about construction noise, delivery truck routing and the fate of smaller, locally owned businesses. “Our task is to ensure that growth doesn’t come at the expense of the very community that made Bakery Square a success,” she said before voting in favor.

Two council members—Corey O’Connor (District 5) and Erika Strassburger (District 11)—voted against the expansion, citing what they described as insufficient guarantees on long-term affordability and limited commitments to local hiring. “We need more enforceable provisions,” said O’Connor. “Without them, we risk another wave of displacement.”

Economic and neighborhood impact
Bakery Square, which launched in 2010 on the site of the former Nabisco cookie factory, has been credited with catalyzing East Liberty’s broader revival. Corporate tenants such as Google and the University of Pittsburgh’s innovation center occupy office towers there, while shops, cafés and a Whole Foods anchor the retail district.

City Council President Theresa Kail-Smith noted at Monday’s meeting that the original Bakery Square spurred an estimated $500 million in adjacent investment and created more than 2,000 local jobs. “This expansion has the potential to carry that momentum forward,” she said.

Local resident Maria Alvarez, who manages a boutique near East Liberty Station, expressed cautious optimism. “It’s great for business foot traffic, but I hope the developers keep rents reasonable for small shops like mine,” she said.

Next steps and timeline
With Council approval secured, Walnut Capital expects to break ground on the residential phase by spring 2026, followed by office construction in early 2027. The public plaza is slated for completion by late 2028, with full build-out expected in mid-2029.

In a statement, Mayor Ed Gainey lauded the decision: “Projects like this demonstrate Pittsburgh’s resurgence as a hub for innovation and community. The expansion of Bakery Square will bring new life to East Liberty while preserving the character that makes our city unique.”

City planning staff will convene a series of follow-up meetings this summer to finalize design details, pedestrian improvements and a construction-phase mitigation plan. Residents and business owners will have further opportunities to weigh in before permits are issued later this year.

"JU min assault: KP on way to Del for scholar’s custody.

Kolkata: The Kolkata Police on Thursday received transit remand from a Delhi local court to bring former Jadavpur University student Hindol Mazumdar to Kolkata.
A cop team is likely to reach the city with the research scholar by Friday morning, after which, he will be produced in a local court in Kolkata where cops will seek his police remand. Mazumdar was detained by Delhi Police at the IGI airport around 10.30 am on Wednesday, upon his arrival from Spain, for allegedly being involved in the harassment of education minister Bratya Basu at JU in March. Lalbazar said he was one of the chief conspirators behind the JU protest. 
The Times of India

“He directed others to the probable places of protest and took care of logistics,” said an officer. 
The Times of India

Sources claim several students from Jadavpur were arrested after the incident, whose questioning led cops to Mazumdar. “Their WhatsApp chats revealed Mazumdar's involvement. Mazumdar, from Spain, instructed attackers from Jadavpur to surround Basu, attack him, and target his car. He was primarily arrested on charges of inciting the attack,” an officer said. 
The Times of India

The cops purportedly shared his WhatsApp messages where he made multiple comments, one of which read, “No organisation other than ours will remain in Jadavpur.” Mazumdar is conducting research in Spain, pursuing a PhD in biomedicine and clinical science at the University of Granada under the EU Marie Sklodowska Curie Action Fellowship. 
The Times of India

He is a long-time associate of the “people's movement” and one of the founding members of the Democratic Youth Students' Association (DYSA). He got a notice on March 16, prompting him to mail the police, saying, “Since Nov 2023, I have been living in Spain, and working towards my doctoral thesis. On March 1, 2025, I was in Spain and, therefore, the question of my presence in Jadavpur on the material day does not and cannot arise at all.” “I learned about Majumdar's arrest from the media, I have no separate statement on the matter,” said Basu. Both of Mazumdar's parents are retired JU professors. His mother Saswati said, “This is harassment. We will fight the case legally.” JUTA general secretary Partha Pratim Ray said, “The arrest shows the revengeful attitude of police, who are trying to damage the career of a student. We want Mazumdar's unconditional release.” Jadavpur University Alumni Organisation stated, “This arrest is a well-planned effort by the state to suppress dissenting voices.” Students from across political organisations, like SFI and AISA, also condemned the “wrongful arrest.” DYSA said the arrest is based on a “completely fictional narrative woven by the police forces.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ju-min-assault-kp-on-way-to-del-for-scholars-custody/articleshow/123311944.cms,real,0
"JU min assault: KP on way to Del for scholar’s custody.

Kolkata, August 25 — A team from the Kolkata Police (KP) is en route to New Delhi to take custody of a scholar accused in the Jadavpur University (JU) minor assault case, sources within the force confirmed on Sunday evening. The move follows the issuance of a transit remand by a Delhi court earlier in the day.

The accused, a 28-year-old former JU research scholar, was detained by Delhi Police late Saturday night from a South Delhi apartment. According to investigators, he had been absconding since his name surfaced in the case involving the alleged assault of a first-year minor student at JU's main hostel earlier this month.

“We received information about his location through electronic surveillance. With cooperation from Delhi Police, our team tracked and detained him. After presenting him in a local court, we secured transit remand,” said a senior officer from Lalbazar, the KP headquarters.

The assault case, which has rocked the academic community and triggered protests across campuses, involves allegations of physical and psychological harassment faced by a 17-year-old student just days after joining JU. The minor was found dead under suspicious circumstances, prompting outrage and an investigation into possible ragging and assault.

So far, multiple students and former scholars have been questioned or arrested in connection with the incident. The latest accused, considered a key figure in the investigation, was reportedly present in the hostel on the night of the alleged assault and is believed to have instigated or directly participated in the act.

Police sources say the team escorting the accused back to Kolkata is expected to arrive by Monday evening. Upon arrival, he will be produced before a city court and likely remanded to police custody for further interrogation.

University authorities, meanwhile, continue to face flak for their handling of the incident, with student unions, faculty members, and civil society groups demanding swift action and long-term reforms in campus safety and oversight.

The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has also taken cognizance of the incident and sought regular updates from the state police on the progress of the investigation.

As the probe intensifies, more arrests and disciplinary actions are likely in the coming days, police indicated.",generate a news article with the following title: JU min assault: KP on way to Del for scholar’s custody. only give me the text of the article,fake,1

"West Coast Under Tsunami Watch After Massive Russian Earthquake.

A magnitude 8.7 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Russia late Tuesday afternoon, leading to a tsunami watch for the entire West Coast of the U.S.

At 6:18 p.m., the California Geological Survey Department of Conservation reported that Tsunami activity was expected to arrive in the Bay Area at 12:40 a.m.

At 6 p.m. the National Weather Service's Bay Area office provided estimated arrival times for California: Monterey at approximately 12:15 a.m., San Francisco at 12:40 a.m., and the Los Angeles harbor at 1:05 a.m.

A tsunami watch means that a tsunami could impact the California coast, but it hasn't been confirmed or detected yet. It's considered a precautionary alert. If a tsunami were considered imminent, United States Geological Survey officials would upgrade the watch to a warning or advisory.

The magnitude 8.7 earthquake occurred off the coast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy in Russia, according to the USGS, causing a tsunami watch for the U.S. West Coast to be issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The temblor was reported just after 4:24 p.m.

The watch zone for the tsunami is the west coast from the California-Mexico border to Alaska, including the San Francisco Bay.

Parts of Alaska are also under tsunami advisory, NOAA reported.

During a Tsunami Watch, a tsunami may be approaching, and residents should remain vigilant for new information.

A Tsunami Warning indicates potential for dangerous flooding, and residents are advised to evacuate to higher elevations immediately.

The earthquake struck approximately 85 miles off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, reaching a depth of nearly 12 mile, according to the USGS.

A magnitude 4.5 earthquake also struck off the coast of Ferndale, according to the United States Geological Survey. The temblor was reported just after 4:18 p.m.

"When poverty steals a breath: Malnutrition crisis in Bajura.

Bajura, Nepal – In the remote hills of Bajura, hunger is not a headline. It is a daily reality. Families walk for hours to fetch a few kilos of rice. Mothers ration food so their children eat at least once a day. The thin arms of toddlers tell a silent story of a district where poverty has stolen the right to grow, to learn, and even to breathe with ease.

According to health workers, Bajura has one of the highest rates of child malnutrition in the country. Cases of stunting and wasting remain widespread, with undernourished children struggling against recurring illness and delayed development. For many, the problem begins before birth. Expectant mothers often lack access to nutritious food, relying instead on maize and millet with little protein or fresh produce.

Hospitals and health posts in the region face shortages of supplements and medicines. Local officials admit that even when relief arrives, reaching scattered mountain villages remains a challenge. “We can bring supplies to the district headquarters, but transporting them to families in the hills is another battle,” said a health officer in Martadi, Bajura’s administrative center.

The crisis is compounded by poverty. Farming is the main source of livelihood, yet erratic rainfall and barren land mean harvests often fail to sustain families year-round. Many men migrate seasonally to India for work, leaving women and children to manage food shortages on their own.

Non-governmental organizations have stepped in with nutrition programs, but the needs far exceed the resources. Teachers report that malnourished students often drop out of school, too weak or too hungry to study. Health experts warn that without urgent intervention, a generation of children will grow up disadvantaged, locked into the same cycle of poverty that starves them today.

For Bajura’s people, the crisis is not only about food—it is about dignity, opportunity, and survival. As one mother put it, “We don’t ask for much. Just enough so our children can live without hunger.”","generate a news article with title, ""When poverty steals a breath: Malnutrition crisis in Bajura""",fake,1

When Bhawana Bisht's two-month-old daughter was admitted to Bajura District Hospital earlier this year, the young mother clung to hope that her baby would recover. Doctors tried, but the little girl's life slipped away.""We wanted to refer her to a bigger hospital,"" said Dr. Prakash Budha. ""But the family had no money, and the baby's condition was already critical. They couldn't take her elsewhere.""Bhawana's story is not unique. In Muktikot village of Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality-1, two more children, 6-month-old Santosh Nyaupane and 17-month-old Jamuna Bk, died of malnutrition. Last year alone, six children from the same settlement lost their lives to the same silent killer.
Today, 25 children in Muktikot are suffering from malnutrition, 11 of them severely. ""The problem is widespread,"" said health worker Birja Bk. ""But official records show nothing.""The numbers don't match the realityThe Bajura District Health Office's official data claims there were only 93 malnourished children under five in the fiscal year 2081/82 (2024–25), with no recorded deaths. Yet municipal records and the Nutrition Rehabilitation Center at Bajura Hospital list 287 children under treatment during the same period, and at least three deaths.""This gap exists because local health facilities don't always report complete data, or entries are delayed,"" admitted data officer Rugam Thapa.A district in crisisAcross Bajura's nine municipalities, hundreds of children face the same fate as Bhawana's daughter. Budhinanda Municipality alone has 83 malnourished children, followed by 37 in Badimalika, 30 in Himali, and dozens more scattered across the hills.""In almost every village, you will find children who are severely underweight, stunted, or wasting away,"" said Deepak Shah, Senior Health Assistant at Budhiganga Municipality. ""The official figures are only the tip of the iceberg.""Health workers point to a cycle of poverty, food insecurity, poor sanitation, lack of awareness, and limited access to healthcare.

But for the hills of Bajura, that goal feels impossibly far away.""Geography, poverty, and systemic neglect mean children here are left behind,"" said one health worker. ""Unless urgent interventions reach the most vulnerable villages, more young lives will be lost quietly, without even appearing in government records.""For mothers like Bhawana, those statistics mean little.

"Informational meeting for Downwinders scheduled at City Hall.

The Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium (TBDC) will host an informational meeting about the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) on August 21 at 5:30 p.m. at Socorro’s City Hall.

Louisa Lopez, a TBDC member, stressed the importance of attending the meeting to receive accurate information and assistance with filing claims, cautioning against potential scams.

A press release from TBDC advises patience while details are finalized, and encourages individuals to seek help from local, fee-free organizations. They also warn against websites that appear helpful but may claim a portion of compensation.

“There are many companies and attorneys from across the country that will be glad to help you with a claim, but you will be required by them to pay a fee and give up part of your claim. There is no need to do that. We will soon have people in place to help file claims,” The press release states.

Downwinders are advised not to share their information with unverified sources; updates will be available on the TBDC website.

The RECA has been reauthorized and extended until December 21, 2028. Downwinders who resided in New Mexico for at least one year between 1944 and November 1962 are eligible, and family members can file claims on behalf of deceased loved ones.

According to TBDC, the RECA expansion now covers 19 types of cancer, with a full list to be released soon. Compensation for downwinders has been increased to $100,000.

​“The application process can be easy for some and more difficult for others, but be assured we will do all we can to assist.” The release said, “What is most important is that you remain patient and understand that assistance will be forthcoming. If you want to start working on paperwork that will be required, you can gather death certificates, birth certificates, and medical records. Other records will likely be required on a case-by-case basis.”",https://www.dchieftain.com/community/informational-meeting-for-downwinders-scheduled-at-city-hall/article_bc1e152c-ea01-4edc-a514-68356471d321.html,real,0
"Informational meeting for Downwinders scheduled at City Hall.

SPRINGFIELD — City officials and local advocates have announced an informational meeting for self-identified “Downwinders” and their families at City Hall on Thursday, September 12, at 6:30 p.m. The session aims to explain available health resources, walk residents through federal compensation programs, and share the latest research on long-term effects of historical nuclear fallout.

“This is about clarity and access,” said Marisol Vega, director of the City’s Office of Community Health. “People deserve straightforward guidance on medical screenings, how to document exposures, and what assistance may be available.”

The evening will feature brief presentations followed by a Q&A. Scheduled speakers include a radiation epidemiologist from Great Basin University, a patient navigator from Springfield Regional Medical Center, and representatives from the Downwinders Support Coalition. Attendees will receive step-by-step checklists on gathering records, contacting primary-care providers, and preparing claims, as well as a directory of clinics offering low- or no-cost screening.

What to expect

6:30–6:45 p.m. Welcome and overview of meeting goals

6:45–7:10 p.m. Health impacts: what current science says

7:10–7:30 p.m. Navigating benefits and compensation programs

7:30–8:00 p.m. Audience questions and individual referrals

For many residents, the term “Downwinders” refers to those who lived, worked, or went to school in areas exposed to radioactive fallout during the era of atmospheric testing. While community advocates stress that not every illness is linked to past exposure, they say early detection and good documentation can make a meaningful difference.

“We’re not here to frighten anyone,” said Eli McAllister, a second-generation advocate who will moderate the Q&A. “We’re here to empower people with practical information—what screenings to request, what paperwork to save, and who to call next.”

To accommodate work schedules, City Hall will open doors at 6:00 p.m. Resource tables with printed guides will be available in the lobby; volunteers can assist with form-filling and notarization for those who need it. The building is ADA accessible; ASL interpretation and Spanish-language translation will be provided. Free parking is available in the Maple Street Garage, and the Route 3 bus stops at the front plaza.

Residents who cannot attend in person may download the materials and watch a recording that will be posted on the city website within 24 hours. Limited one-on-one appointments with patient navigators will be offered the following week on a first-come basis.

"Mayfield & Bethany Roads Are Open Again.

After months of detours, dust, and construction delays, drivers in the eastern part of the county can finally breathe a sigh of relief—Mayfield and Bethany Roads are officially open again.

The heavily used connector roads, which had been closed since early spring for a full repaving and culvert replacement project, reopened to traffic Monday morning, two weeks ahead of schedule. Crews worked extended hours through July to wrap up final touches, including fresh striping, new guardrails, and improved signage.

For many local residents and commuters, the reopening marks the end of long backroad detours and increased congestion along alternate routes. “It’s a huge relief,” said Carla Denson, who lives just off Bethany Road. “I’ve been adding 15 minutes to every trip since March.”

The county’s transportation department confirmed the $3.2 million project was part of a larger rural infrastructure upgrade funded by a mix of state and federal grants. In addition to new roadbeds and drainage improvements, several utility lines were upgraded during the closure period.

Drivers are encouraged to remain cautious as crews will still be working on minor shoulder work and reseeding through next week. But for now, the orange cones are gone, and normal travel can finally resume.","generate an article given this title:

"Gambhira bridge collapse: Industrial units in Padra announces relief to workers travelling from Anand.

Gambhira bridge collapse: Industrial units in Padra announces relief to workers travelling from Anand
On July 9, 2025, the Gambhira bridge, a critical connection between Anand and Vadodara districts in Gujarat, collapsed, claiming at least 11 lives and injuring several others. Spanning the Mahisagar river, the over-40-year-old structure was a lifeline for thousands of commuters, including workers from Anand who travel daily to industrial units in Padra taluka of Vadodara district. Its sudden collapse has disrupted this vital route, forcing people to take lengthy detours.
Severe Impact on Workers
The bridge’s collapse has hit hard for approximately 4,000 workers from Anand employed across 53 industrial units in Padra. These workers now face commutes extended by up to 70 kilometers due to alternative routes. For many, especially daily wage earners, this means not only lost time but also higher transportation costs, adding a significant financial strain to their lives.
Relief Measures Announced
In a compassionate response, industrial units in Padra have stepped up with relief measures to ease the burden on their workforce. These include:

Shift Adjustments: Moving workers to general shifts to avoid peak traffic and unsafe travel times.
Increased Travel Allowances: Providing financial support to offset the added commuting costs.
Relaxed Attendance Rules: Reducing mandatory workdays, with some companies dropping the requirement from 25 to 22 days a month, acknowledging the logistical challenges.

Some companies are even exploring the possibility of starting their own transportation services, offering a potential long-term solution for affected workers.
Government Support
The state government has played a key role in these efforts. After the collapse, the district industries center and labor department urged companies to assist their employees, fostering a coordinated response that reflects a commitment to worker welfare during this crisis.
Why It Matters
These measures are a lifeline not just for the workers but also for the industries in Padra, which depend on a reliable workforce to sustain production and meet business demands. By supporting their employees, these companies are helping ensure operational continuity despite the disruption.
A Wake-Up Call
The tragedy also exposes critical gaps in infrastructure maintenance. Reports suggest the Gambhira bridge was in poor condition, with prior warnings about its safety ignored. This preventable disaster highlights the urgent need for better oversight and timely repairs to safeguard such essential structures.
Looking Ahead
As the region awaits the bridge’s reconstruction—currently in the tendering stage following government funding approval—these relief initiatives offer vital support. Meanwhile, an ongoing investigation into the collapse must deliver accountability and drive stronger measures to protect critical infrastructure. For now, the actions of Padra’s industrial units stand out as a commendable example of corporate responsibility in the face of adversity.","You are a news article writer at indianexpress.com.

While some have put workers on general shift or plan to increase travel allowance, others brought relaxation in attendance

As villagers in Anand district, who work at industrial units in Vadodara’s Padra taluka, have been facing issues in commuting to work following the Mujpur-Gambhira bridge collapse, these units have assured relief in terms of shifts and timings to its workers.

On July 10, The Indian Express reported how the bridge over Mahi was a lifeline for over 40 years for the residents of Gambhira and other villages in Anand district, saving them the trouble of having to travel an extra 70 km to the factories of Vadodara on the other side. After the bridge collapse, however, they were staring at an uncertain future.

The state government on Tuesday announced that “considering the difficulties faced by the workers due to the collapse of the Mujpur-Gambhira bridge, the employing companies are taking relief measures following the intervention of the district industries centre and the labour department of the state government”.

While some companies have decided to start their own transportation facilities, some have agreed to increase the vehicle allowance of their workers, the announcement from the state government also said.

There are around 53 industrial units operating in Padra taluka on the Vadodara side of the Mahi river. Government records stated that the number of workers travelling from Anand to these units stands at around 4,000.

The state government further said that some companies have also announced relaxation in attendance for their workers. For example, instead of 25 days a month, workers of some companies are now required to be present for 22 days. In addition, companies have also decided to put workers, who take the Anand route, on general shifts. Some companies are also considering increasing the transportation allowance for their employees.

“After the bridge collapse, considering the transportation difficulties faced by the workers, the District Industries Center and the Labor Department intervened with the relevant companies. Through which, relief decisions have been taken by the companies for the workers. Many companies have instructed their contractors to arrange private vehicles. Most companies have arranged transportation for their workers. Relaxation in working hours has been given due to changing routes,” the statement issued by the state government said.

The state government further said that apart from this, some companies have also announced relaxation in attendance for their workers. For example, instead of 25 days a month, workers of some companies are now required to be present for 22 days. In addition, companies have also decided to put workers, who take the Anand route, on general shifts. Some companies are considering increasing the transportation allowance for their employees.

"Umami Moto serving up Asian-fusion all around Albuquerque.

ALBUQUERQUE, NM — A bold new flavor is hitting the streets of Albuquerque, and it’s coming from four wheels. Umami Moto, the vibrant food truck specializing in Asian-fusion cuisine, is turning heads — and satisfying taste buds — across the city.

Launched earlier this year by local chef and entrepreneur Maya Lin, Umami Moto fuses bold flavors from Korean, Thai, Japanese, and Vietnamese cuisines with Southwestern flair. The result? Dishes like kimchi queso fries, miso-lime chicken tacos, and bánh mì burritos that are as inventive as they are addictive.

“We wanted to create something that was craveable, shareable, and uniquely New Mexico,” said Lin. “Albuquerque has such an amazing food culture, and we’re proud to be part of that.”

Since its debut, the truck has been popping up at breweries, music festivals, and popular lunch spots across the city, quickly earning a devoted following. On any given day, lines form well before opening — especially for their signature dish: crispy tempura cauliflower with gochujang aioli and pickled red onions.

Beyond food, Umami Moto stands out for its electric-pink truck, sleek branding, and commitment to sustainability. All packaging is compostable, and the team sources ingredients locally whenever possible.

The truck's rotating weekly schedule is shared via Instagram and their official website, making it easy for fans to track it down.

"Hamilton likely to drop to fifth-largest county in Tennessee.

Hamilton County, long known as one of Tennessee’s four largest counties by population, is poised to slip to fifth place for the first time in decades. According to preliminary estimates from the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, recent population booms in both Rutherford and Williamson counties are reshuffling the state's demographic hierarchy—leaving Hamilton on the edge of being overtaken.

Growth Outpaced by Middle Tennessee Surge
While Hamilton County, home to Chattanooga, has experienced steady population growth in recent years, it has been dwarfed by the explosive expansion of counties in the Nashville metropolitan area. Rutherford County, anchored by Murfreesboro, has already surged past Hamilton, and now Williamson County—known for its affluent suburbs like Franklin and Brentwood—is projected to edge ahead by early 2026.

“These aren’t just blips,” said Dr. Elaine Foster, a demographer at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. “We’re seeing a sustained pattern of migration toward Middle Tennessee, driven by job opportunities, suburban expansion, and a broader economic shift.”

According to the most recent state estimates, Hamilton County's population stands at just over 376,000. Williamson County, which had trailed closely for years, is now estimated at approximately 374,500 and growing at a faster rate—nearly 2.8% annually compared to Hamilton’s 1.1%.

Economic and Lifestyle Factors at Play
Experts point to a combination of factors fueling the trend. The tech and healthcare sectors in the Nashville metro area have drawn in both employers and young professionals. In contrast, Hamilton County's growth has been more moderate, with fewer large-scale housing developments and a slower influx of new industries.

“There’s a lot to love about Chattanooga,” said local realtor Alex Romero. “But we’re not seeing the same pace of corporate relocations or large master-planned communities that you find in Middle Tennessee.”

Rising housing costs in Hamilton, especially in the downtown and North Shore areas, have also contributed to slower in-migration, particularly among younger families.

Local Leaders Respond
County Mayor Weston Wamp acknowledged the shifting landscape but struck an optimistic tone in a recent press conference.

“We’re focused on smart, sustainable growth,” Wamp said. “Rankings fluctuate, but what matters is quality of life, infrastructure, and opportunity. Hamilton County is strong, and our best days are still ahead.”

Wamp noted several initiatives aimed at retaining and attracting residents, including investments in riverfront development, expanded broadband access in rural areas, and a renewed push to recruit tech startups.

Still, local officials are not ignoring the symbolic weight of falling behind counties that, just a generation ago, had far smaller populations.

Looking Ahead
If trends continue, Williamson County is expected to officially surpass Hamilton County by early next year, with census confirmation to follow in 2030. Shelby, Davidson, Knox, and—soon—Williamson will comprise the top four counties in Tennessee by population.

Despite the shift, local residents remain proud of Chattanooga’s distinct culture, scenic beauty, and growing reputation as a hub for outdoor recreation and clean energy.

“I don’t really care what number we are,” said longtime resident Sherrie Long. “This city has soul. You don’t measure that in population charts.”

Still, the numbers don’t lie—and they’re pointing to a new demographic order in Tennessee.",generate a news article on Hamilton likely to drop to fifth-largest county in Tennessee. Make it as realistic as possible without searching the web.,fake,1
"Hamilton likely to drop to fifth-largest county in Tennessee.

Hamilton County is likely to lose its spot as Tennessee's fourth-most populous county within the next five years, according to a state analysis.

A 2024 analysis from the Boyd Center at the University of Tennessee had projected Rutherford County would surpass Hamilton County's population by this month, based on population numbers released by the census in 2022.

Those numbers have since been revised, partly to account for international migration, researcher Tim Kuhn said.

New population estimates from 2024 show Hamilton County has surpassed the center's projected population while Rutherford County has underperformed.

Now, Rutherford County is projected to overtake Hamilton County by 2030 or earlier, Kuhn said by phone.

""There is this eventuality,"" Kuhn said. ""It will happen sometime.""

Tennessee saw a historic number of new residents in 2022, Kuhn said, adding around 81,300 more people than it lost. In 2023, 90 of Tennessee's 95 counties grew, Kuhn said. In the previous decade, 65 counties added to their net population, he said.

""Trying to make a projection in the midst of that, there's definitely a chance for a lot of uncertainty,"" Kuhn said.

A 2019 report forecasted Rutherford County would surpass Hamilton County in population by 2026, foreseeing high growth in Middle Tennessee, including Nashville and its surrounding communities.

Rutherford County, near Nashville and home to Murfreesboro and Middle Tennessee State University, was the state's fastest-growing county from 2016 to 2022, Kuhn said. Now, it ranks second behind Davidson County.

The county has a younger overall population, Kuhn said, with a median age of around 35.5 compared to Hamilton County's nearly 41.

Since 2020, it also saw natural growth, which measures how many more births there are than deaths, around 10 times higher than Hamilton County's, Kuhn said. Where Hamilton County saw around 700 more births than deaths in that time, Rutherford County logged around 7,300.

Rutherford County also had around 7,000 more people move in from within the U.S. than Hamilton County since 2020, Kuhn said.

Now, Kuhn said there's about a 10,000-person difference between the two counties, which Rutherford County is projected to overcome by 2030.

FEELING PRESSURE

Rutherford County is facing growth pressures that might feel familiar to Hamilton County residents.

Both counties are about two years into the process of drafting new strategic plans to guide future growth, trying to balance demand for more housing with a good quality of life for existing residents.

Local officials said Hamilton County should focus on being better, not necessarily bigger.

Hamilton County Mayor Weston Wamp said he doesn't see any downside to no longer being the fourth-largest county in the state.

Wamp said the county is a regional economic and cultural hub, with an economic output about 40% higher than Rutherford County's.

""In Hamilton County, we should be intentional to prioritize gains in our quality of life and educational outcomes, not necessarily population growth,"" Wamp said in an email. ""As Rutherford County has experienced over the last decade, unsustainable residential growth leads to infrastructure challenges and inevitable tax increases.""

Wamp said those challenges in Rutherford County include school overcrowding, which some Hamilton County residents have also flagged as a concern.

While Rutherford County is relatively flat with ample farmland (meaning it's easy to build on), Hamilton County has a river, mountains and ridges that make residential development more difficult, Wamp said.

(SIGN UP: Get our top headlines in your inbox every morning by going to timesfreepress.com/morning)

Like in Hamilton County, Rutherford County leaders have pointed out that new residential growth doesn't pay for itself when accounting for additional tax revenue versus the added burden on resources and infrastructure.

""In Hamilton County, we have a much more appropriate blend of residential and commercial properties in our tax base,"" Wamp said.

Wamp said Rutherford County Mayor Joe Carr, who came into office at the same time as him, ""has done a great job turning things around financially.""

BY THE NUMBERS

Tennessee as a whole is growing, around 1% per year. Much of that growth is centered around its biggest cities and in Middle and East Tennessee, data shows, though the post-pandemic spike also affected more rural counties.

Between 2023 and 2024, Rutherford County gained around 7,000 residents, the second-most in the state behind Davidson County, data from the Boyd Center shows.

Hamilton County added nearly 5,000 residents in that time.

(READ MORE: Growth concerns come to Signal Mountain)

""Hamilton County has had sustained population growth, and there's no reason to think that that's going to change,"" Kuhn, the researcher, said. ""It is likely that it is going to slow somewhat, but that's true of what's happening across the state as a whole.""

Shelby County remains the most populous county in Tennessee, though it is slowly losing residents and projections show Davidson County could overtake it by 2048.

Knox County has the third-highest population, at around 508,000 residents in 2025, according to Boyd Center data.

Projections show Hamilton County's population increasing by around 4,000 residents from 2024 to 2025, to around 385,000. Rutherford County added a projected 9,000 residents, increasing its estimated population to nearly 389,000.

ECONOMIC IMPACT?

It helps to take a longer view of growth, said Jeremy Henderson, a spokesperson for the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce.

While many in Hamilton County seem to think the county is growing too fast, Henderson said it's nowhere near the fastest in the state.

""The truth is, we're not growing as fast as people think we are,"" Henderson said by phone. ""People are understandably hesitant about growth. I get it. No one wants completely unchecked growth. It needs to be intentional ... but there's a difference between being intentional and just saying we shouldn't have it at all.""

Between the 2010 and 2020 census, the county ranked 11th-fastest in Tennessee with a growth rate of 8.8%, census data shows.

Neighboring Bradley County edged into the top 10, growing by 9.7% in that time, according to census data.

Rutherford County was the second-fastest growing county in that decade, increasing its population by 30%, while Williamson County grew by around 35%.

(READ MORE: Chattanooga's top planner resigns after report finds pattern of demeaning behavior)

It's unclear what the economic impact of no longer being the state's fourth-largest county would be, Henderson said.

""Employers look at such a broad range of factors when they're considering where to locate,"" he said. ""I can't tell you it has no effect, but I'm not prepared to tell you that it's a large one, either.""

To be ready for future growth opportunities, Henderson said the chamber would like to see a variety of shovel-ready sites made available for new facilities and employers.

(READ MORE: Hamilton County Mayor Wamp says $3 billion project not realistic for McDonald Farm)

""The chamber's focus is always going to be job creation and making sure that we have the infrastructure in place so that when opportunities arise, we're able to capitalize on them,"" he said.

That necessary infrastructure could be additional sewer connections or rezoning approvals, he said.

GROWING PAINS

As some Hamilton County residents grapple with their growing area, some have cited Rutherford County as an example of how to do it right.

The county's Consolidated Utility District was used as a benchmark when Hamilton County's Water and Wastewater Treatment Authority updated its rules for decentralized sewer systems earlier this year.

The systems allow development in areas not connected to traditional sewer lines, which opens up more rural areas for residential growth.

The Consolidated Utility District has the best track record for the systems in the state, said George Nolan, the Tennessee director for the Southern Environmental Law Center. Now, Hamilton County's regulations are likely the strictest of any Tennessee county.

In a recent presentation to county commissioners, members of the Hamilton County Citizens for Responsible Development showed that Hamilton County allows the most homes per acre in its agricultural zone, the lowest-density designation, of the state's fastest-growing counties.

The county's agricultural zone allows for two homes per acre, while the equivalent zone in Rutherford county allows 0.2 homes per acre, data compiled by the group shows.

County Commission Chair Jeff Eversole, R-Ooltewah, said he thinks Rutherford County has done a better job of limiting its density to specific areas to maintain rural character elsewhere.

""In their growth strategy, they have more sewer, they've got more infrastructure things that they planned years ago that are in place, that drives density in specific areas,"" Eversole said by phone. ""They also have designated certain areas to where they want low density.""

It's not reasonable or financially responsible to extend big roads, more schools and other infrastructure to all parts of the county, Eversole said, so the growth plan needs to be selective about where to allow more dense development.

He said he believes it's possible to keep growth neutral in more rural areas of unincorporated Hamilton County with the right planning. But for a long time, without a plan in place, landowners were allowed to do whatever they wanted in those areas -- including selling property to subdivision developers at high prices.

As growth continues, he worries that rural landowners will move outside the county to more open areas like North Georgia or Bradley, Meigs or Sequatchie counties.

""I think we can have it all,"" Eversole said. ""But if we're not careful, we'll lose that. And my goal is we don't lose that.""",https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2025/jul/22/hamilton-likely-to-drop-to-fifth-largest-county/,real,0
"Overland Park wants to turn corporate College corridor into the city’s new center.

OVERLAND PARK, Kan. — City officials unveiled an ambitious 15-year master plan Tuesday that would transform the corporate-heavy College Boulevard corridor into a vibrant mixed-use downtown district, complete with residential towers, retail spaces, and cultural amenities.
The ""College Center Vision 2040"" proposal targets the 3-mile stretch between Metcalf and Nall avenues, an area currently dominated by office parks, surface parking lots, and aging corporate campuses. Mayor Sarah Chen announced the initiative at a packed city council meeting, calling it ""the most transformative project in Overland Park's history.""
""We have this incredible opportunity to reimagine what our city center could be,"" Chen said. ""Instead of people driving through Overland Park to get somewhere else, we want to create a destination where people choose to live, work, and play.""
The plan envisions replacing several underutilized office complexes with mixed-use developments featuring ground-floor retail, mid-rise apartments, and preserved green spaces. A proposed light rail connection would link the new district to downtown Kansas City and Johnson County Community College.
Key elements of the proposal include:

Converting the former Sprint campus into a 500-unit residential complex with retail
Creating a central park and amphitheater where the current Metcalf South shopping center stands
Establishing dedicated bike lanes and pedestrian walkways throughout the corridor
Attracting a major grocery chain and entertainment venue as anchor tenants

The project faces significant hurdles, including negotiating with current property owners and securing estimated $800 million in public-private financing. Several major corporations have expressed interest in relocating their offices to the mixed-use towers, according to Economic Development Director Mark Rodriguez.
""The pandemic changed how people think about work-life balance,"" Rodriguez explained. ""Companies want to be in walkable environments where their employees can grab lunch, meet friends, or catch a movie without getting back in their cars.""
Not everyone supports the ambitious timeline. City Council member Janet Walsh raised concerns about traffic congestion and the displacement of existing businesses during the lengthy construction period.
""I love the vision, but we need to be realistic about the disruption this will cause,"" Walsh said. ""We're talking about essentially rebuilding half our city while people are still trying to live and work here.""
Public input sessions are scheduled for August, with a final council vote expected in September. If approved, preliminary demolition could begin as early as spring 2026.
The proposal has drawn comparisons to successful downtown revitalization projects in nearby Leawood and Lenexa, though urban planning experts note Overland Park's much larger scale presents unique challenges.
""This is either going to be a model for suburban reinvention or a cautionary tale,"" said Dr. Patricia Hernandez, a urban studies professor at the University of Kansas. ""The success will depend entirely on execution and whether they can maintain momentum over such a long timeline.""","News Title - Overland Park wants to turn corporate College corridor into the city’s new center

"Overland Park wants to turn corporate College corridor into the city’s new center.

With Overland Park’s plans to move city hall to the College Boulevard and Metcalf area and Black & Veatch’s plan for a new, $1 billion headquarters, attention is back on long-range plans to reimagine the center of the city.

Historically defined by large office users, the corridor has been a hot topic for many years as Overland Park ponders the future of the area around its convention center — dubbed OP Central.

“We’ve spent a lot of time on this corridor thinking about how it can transition into the future,” Mayor Curt Skoog said during a recent Overland Park City Council meeting.

The city’s current vision, crafted through multiple planning processes, is to remake some of the underutilized office developments that have traditionally served as the city’s primary industry into a more vibrant, mixed-use area with amenities to serve both workers and visitors.

How did Overland Park get here?

Nearly 20 years ago, Overland Park adopted its Vision Metcalf plan, which aimed to revitalize the city’s economic backbone. A few years later, it was clear that some of the ideas that came out of that could be applied to College Boulevard as well, said Leslie Karr, director of planning for Overland Park, particularly where it intersects with Metcalf.

As a major economic hub — one of the most densely packed job centers in the metro area — Overland Park considers this corridor to be key to its long-term fiscal health and the success of its primary industry of office.

But the past focus on offices alone in the area posed a threat to the corridor’s long-term viability, especially as the idea of office work continues to evolve.

Karr said the city was starting to hear from the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce and Visit OP — the city’s tourism arm — about how the changing needs of both office users and business travel could affect the office industry about 10 years ago.

Councilmember Jim Kite, who represents this area of the city, said it started to become clear that the city needed to “reimagine a very sterile intersection” at College and Metcalf and the surrounding area.

“It was just big, tall glass buildings and a handful of restaurants, and it just wasn’t what it could be,” he said.

Eventually, those considerations prompted the city to contract with a consultant to craft what is now called the OP Central Master Plan with the support of a federal Planning Sustainable Places grant via the Mid-America Regional Council. The 2018 plan called for reimagining the corridor with new mixed-use development and redevelopment that would prioritize people living, working and playing in one area.

“It used to be just an office building in a field was kind of the ideal, and now people want to be able to walk to lunch and walk to other services and have a place after work to go with coworkers and socialize or entertain clients,” Karr said.

Going beyond office uses in the OP Central area

Karr said those ideas in past planning efforts will help the city create an “18-hour environment.”

“Instead of everybody coming there, working for the day, leaving at 5 p.m., you have reasons for people to be supporting retail and restaurants beyond those hours,” she said. “You create some more activity and things for people to do along the corridor.”
College and Metcalf OP Central
A group looked at how to make Overland Park’s College-and-Metcalf corridor attractive to businesses, saying taming traffic would be key in 2018. Rendering credit Perkins+Will.

All of that led the city to focus on implementation, resulting in the 2021 College + Metcalf Mobility Study that emphasized walkability, and more recent efforts to create a special zoning district in the area similar to the downtown district that’s now been wrapped up in a general city-wide development code update.

“If we want this city to have … the gathering places, the magnets to draw interest to this community,” Kite said, “the area right there at that intersection and along College has to be reimagined.”

He added that he believes the current focus on more mixed-use and walkable uses is “the right approach.” Kite also said that with the convention center in the corridor, and now with city hall planned nearby, Overland Park has a vested interest in ensuring it all comes together.

On top of all of that, Karr said, since the area is already pretty densely packed, it could be a good fit for denser housing options, like multistory apartment buildings. That would allow the city to capitalize on other goals related to adding more places to live without touching residents who are opposed to such projects.

Overland Park could pursue OP Central sales tax incentives

Additionally, Overland Park has started exploring the possibility of imposing special, limited sales taxes that could, if ultimately adopted, help reimburse the city for some of the expenses incurred from the purchase of the new city hall site. It could also potentially help pay for long-term mobility enhancements long planned in the corridor.

Earlier this month, City Attorney Michael Koss said using sales taxes — in the form of a Transportation Development District and/or a Community Improvement District — to help pay for the upgrades in line with the College Metcalf Mobility Study.

“We think it has the potential to help achieve city objectives in this area and benefit our residents,” Koss said.

The details related to all of that are still being sorted out, especially in light of potentially overlapping incentive requests from Black & Veatch that include a CID sales tax as well as existing incentives on the Galleria 115 development area. Koss suggested that the city and private entities could submit a joint petition or share the sales tax revenues.

Still, the city council gave preliminary support on July 7 for staff to start negotiating with the goal of capping all combined incentive sales taxes at 2%. To actually form the districts, the issue will have to return to the city council for full approval.
$5.3M in mobility improvements planned next year

In the meantime, Overland Park has scheduled about $5.3 million in corridor enhancements for sometime next year, focused particularly on improving bike and foot access around College and Metcalf.

According to the city’s capital improvement plan for next year, the project’s primary goal is “enhancing active transportation choices to connect employees, visitors and residents to employment, hotels and other amenities along the corridor.”

It will include:

    a new linear park — a long and skinny public green space — on College
    intersection upgrades
    multiuse paths to connect College to a trail
    more bike and pedestrian connections
    more visible crosswalks and wayfinding signs

Overland Park is set to receive $1.35 million in federal funds via MARC for the project. Work is expected to wrap up by the end of 2026.

Plus, the 2018 mobility study called for other potential improvement projects focused on pedestrian access that the city hasn’t ruled out entirely, including a possible footbridge over Metcalf.

Karr said, with Overland Park investing millions of dollars into its new city hall project in the corridor, the city has “a lot of opportunity” to continue pondering additional mobility upgrades, new amenities and other types of enhancements as well.",https://johnsoncountypost.com/2025/07/29/op-central-history-explained-265199/,real,0
"Best Wok has re-opened in Great Falls.

In a stunning turn of events, traffic came to a standstill, yoga classes were canceled, and city council members were spotted in pajama pants as Best Wok officially reopened its doors Thursday morning.
Witnesses say the line began forming at 3:47 a.m., with locals abandoning their jobs, pets, and in one case, a live Zoom deposition, to secure a spot for the legendary General Tso's chicken.
""I haven't seen this much excitement since the great ranch dressing spill of 2013,"" said Police Chief Barry Mullens, who was last seen directing traffic while holding a container of crab rangoon.
Chaos reached peak levels when a man attempted to cut in line claiming he was ""part of the wok development team."" He was gently escorted out by a group of elderly women wielding chopsticks.

At this point, there is no word on the reason for the extended closure.
Reporter Quentin Shores has an interview scheduled for Friday with Best Wok - we will update you then.
(MAY 7, 2025) The Best Wok restaurant at 1800 10th Avenue South has been closed for several months - and the closure has had many people wondering if and when it will re-open.
Some people noted on social media that the restaurant periodically closes for several weeks each year as the owners travel, but this year, the closure has lasted for more than three months.
The sign posted on the door simply states ""Closed for vacation"" - but does not give any indication of a re-opening date.
Nobody seems to know the reason for the extended closure, or whether it is permanent. We have tried calling several times over the last few months, but the calls have not been answered.
But this week, people noticed a new sign posted on the door - it states ""Experienced cook needed,"" along with two phone numbers.
So despite not revealing a possible re-opening date, the new sign at least provides a sense of relief and/or hope that Best Wok will soon be serving up favorites again.

On February 9, 2024, at around 3:10am, Rising Sun Produce experienced a fire which caused its first and only long-term closure since its opening in 1979. For years, Rising Sun has been the go-to spot for students as it carries budget-friendly produce and is stocked with a variety of snacks and spices.

To help get this beloved store back up and running after the fire, GoFundMes were created by the Ravenna community and the landlord helped to cover the renovation costs. Thanks to the sup-
port of persistent customers, friends, and family, Rising Sun was able to announce in August that it would rebuild.

Bud Goodwin, the owner of Rising Sun, admits that due to the fire, the question of reopening was unknown. “When the fire first happened, and we came here…it was a disaster. The doors were all broken down, the place was filled with smoke, I thought there was no way we could continue.” While the fire didn’t make it into the building, Goodwin stated that “it got really really hot inside the store, so hot that it melted the cash register… all the produce we had in there was destroyed too.”

One of Goodwin’s employees suggested creating a GoFundMe page, but he was reluctant as he did not want
anyone to give him anything. Despite his hesitance, “As soon as [Goodwin’s employee] started it, there was an incredible response from the community.”

Goodwin wanted to give thanks to the community, so prior to its opening, Rising Sun hosted a restoration party of about 350 people. Since its opening, Rising Sun has always had a large community.

"UTC suspends all Greek life activities following hazing investigation.

All fraternity and sorority operations halted pending completion of comprehensive review
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga has issued an immediate suspension of all Greek life activities on campus following allegations of hazing within multiple organizations, university officials announced Tuesday.
The suspension, which affects all 24 fraternities and sororities at UTC, prohibits chapters from holding meetings, social events, recruitment activities, philanthropic events, or any other organizational functions until further notice. The decision comes after the university received what administrators described as ""credible and concerning reports"" of hazing incidents involving at least three Greek organizations over the past month.
""The safety and wellbeing of our students is our highest priority,"" said UTC Chancellor Steven Angle in a campus-wide email. ""These allegations represent a serious violation of our community standards and Tennessee state law. We will not tolerate any behavior that endangers our students.""
The university has not released specific details about the nature of the alleged hazing incidents, citing the ongoing investigation and student privacy concerns. However, sources familiar with the matter indicate that the allegations involve both physical and psychological hazing practices during new member initiation processes.
The suspension affects approximately 1,400 students who are members of UTC's Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and National Pan-Hellenic Council organizations, representing roughly 12% of the undergraduate student body.
""This is a difficult but necessary decision,"" said Dr. Katie High, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. ""We recognize that many students in our Greek community are not involved in these behaviors, but the severity of these allegations requires a comprehensive response.""
The university has contracted an external firm specializing in Greek life assessment to conduct a thorough review of all chapters. Each organization will be required to participate in mandatory anti-hazing education and undergo individual chapter reviews before being considered for reinstatement.
Student reactions to the suspension have been mixed. Sarah Martinez, a junior and member of Alpha Delta Pi, expressed frustration with the blanket suspension. ""It's unfair that all organizations are being punished for the actions of a few. My sorority has worked hard to maintain a positive culture, and now we can't even hold our scheduled charity fundraiser.""
However, other students support the administration's decision. ""If this is what it takes to change the culture and make Greek life safer, then I'm all for it,"" said Michael Thompson, a sophomore who previously dropped out of the fraternity recruitment process due to concerns about hazing.
The suspension comes amid heightened scrutiny of Greek life practices nationwide. According to data from the National Collaborative for Hazing Research and Prevention, at least one hazing-related death has occurred on a U.S. college campus each year since 1961, with several high-profile incidents in recent years prompting universities to reevaluate their oversight of Greek organizations.
UTC's Interfraternity Council President, Jake Williams, released a statement saying the council is ""committed to working with the university to address these serious concerns and to fostering a culture of respect and safety within our community.""
The university has established a confidential reporting hotline for students who may have information about hazing incidents. Counseling services have also been made available for affected students.
This marks the first complete suspension of Greek life at UTC since 2009, when similar measures were taken following alcohol-related incidents. That suspension lasted six weeks before organizations were allowed to resume activities under stricter guidelines.
University officials say they hope to complete the investigation and review process within 30 to 45 days, though the timeline could be extended depending on the findings. Individual chapters found to have engaged in hazing could face permanent removal from campus, while those cleared of violations may be permitted to resume operations under enhanced monitoring.
The Hamilton County District Attorney's Office confirmed it is monitoring the university's investigation and will review findings to determine if criminal charges are warranted. Under Tennessee law, hazing that results in serious bodily injury is a Class C felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
As the investigation continues, UTC administrators emphasize their commitment to maintaining Greek life on campus while ensuring it operates safely and in alignment with the university's values.
""Greek organizations have the potential to provide valuable leadership development, community service, and lifelong friendships,"" Chancellor Angle said. ""But these benefits cannot come at the cost of student safety. We will work diligently to address these issues and create a path forward for a healthier Greek life community at UTC.""
The university has scheduled a town hall meeting for Thursday evening to address questions from students, parents, and alumni about the suspension and the path forward for Greek life at UTC.",create a realistic news article with this title: UTC suspends all Greek life activities following hazing investigation,fake,1
"UTC suspends all Greek life activities following hazing investigation.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga has placed a temporary moratorium on all fraternity and sorority activities until Friday, September 5, 2025, as the school continues to respond to concerns about hazing.

In light of recent events that have appeared in the media and raised concerns regarding fraternity and sorority life, the University is placing a temporary moratorium on all fraternity and sorority activities, effective immediately. These incidents do not reflect the values of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga or our Greek Life community; however, they underscore the need to pause, reflect, and take meaningful steps to ensure the health and safety of all students,"" said Dr. Artanya Wesley, Vice Chancellor for Enrollment Management and Student Affairs.
The suspension, announced Thursday, pauses all Greek Life events including social activities, recruitment, new member education, and organizational programs. UTC officials said the pause will allow administrators, student leaders, and national organizations to review policies on safety, risk management, and harm reduction. A mandatory community meeting for all fraternity and sorority members is scheduled for Tuesday, September 2, from 5 to 8 p.m. in McKenzie Arena.

UTC leaders stressed that the action is not tied to any single event but is part of a larger effort to strengthen oversight of Greek Life. Still, the announcement comes after a widely reported investigation into the Alpha-Iota Chapter of Kappa Sigma.

HAZING INVESTIGATION INTO KAPPA SIGMA:

Through an open records request, NewsChannel 9 obtained investigative files from a September 2024 incident where two pledges were seriously burned during a fraternity ritual known as the “Weather Pledge.”


Photo from the UTC investigation shows the list of videos obtained as evidence.

The report describes both “overt and subtle pressure” to take part in dangerous activities. Videos show pledges applying lemon juice to their eyes, jumping from rooftops, and setting their chests on fire after covering them in rubbing alcohol.

Two students were hospitalized with second-degree burns. One suffered burns over 6% of his body; the other over 25%, requiring skin grafts. Both later told investigators their participation was voluntary, but also acknowledged they would have stopped if chapter leaders had intervened.

The investigation says chapter leaders initially denied knowledge of hazing but later admitted they were aware and failed to act. It also documents efforts to destroy evidence, including instructions to get rid of pledge books and delete videos.

Despite the findings, District Attorney Shari Tayloe announced in June that no criminal charges would be filed. UTC has since placed the chapter on interim suspension and referred the case to the Office of Student Conduct for review under the Student Code of Conduct.


Photo from the UTC investigation shows text messages with Steve Smith.

ETHICS CONCERNS AND ALLEGED INTERFERENCE:

The investigative file also raised questions about possible interference by local officials who are Kappa Sigma alumni.

The report alleges Assistant District Attorney Kevin Loper shared information about the case with Public Defender Steve Smith, and minimized the incident when briefing District Attorney Coty Wamp, saying it was “no big deal.”

Wamp later recused herself from the case. Loper also recused himself, and Tayloe confirmed she is reviewing potential ethical violations.

The report also references Judge Boyd Patterson, who acknowledged he spoke with a student and a UTC detective about the case, but said he made it clear he could not assist them and instead connected them with others.


Judge Boyd Patterson

The case was reviewed by the Chattanooga Police Department, the FBI, and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Officials determined it did not meet the threshold for public corruption charges.

UTC Vice Chancellor Jay Blackman said in a statement that the university is continuing its review to determine whether the behavior violated the Student Code of Conduct.

WHAT'S NEXT:

For now, UTC says the Greek Life moratorium will remain in place until September 5. Leaders say the pause is designed to ensure fraternity and sorority life continues “in ways that uphold community standards and foster a culture of care, accountability, leadership, and respect.”",https://newschannel9.com/news/local/utc-suspends-all-greek-life-activities-following-hazing-investigation#,real,0

"Summer Sightings: A Nature Column.

Early dawn finds the hedgerows alive with restless chatter. Warblers weave among hawthorn blooms, rehearsing a chorus that will carry straight through September, while swallows loop low over pastures, stitching the horizon with threads of cobalt and cream. By mid-morning, the meadows are awash in movement: red admirals test the air above nettle beds, and meadow browns rise in lazy spirals each time a tractor’s breeze rattles the grasses. If you pause beside a field gate and wait, the landscape reveals itself in small, extraordinary increments.

This season’s heat has coaxed out an abundance of damselflies along streams and drainage ditches. Banded demoiselles—those indigo pennants—flare across sun-dappled water, their metallic wings flashing like coins in a wishing well. Ecologists at the county wildlife trust report counts nearly a third higher than last year’s, crediting a wetter-than-average spring and a growing network of unmown buffer strips that protect larval habitat.

Not all visitors arrive on wings. At dusk, hedgehogs resume their nightly patrols, snuffling beneath garden fences in search of slugs that thrive after sudden summer showers. If you spot one, resist the impulse to leave milk: fresh water, a shallow dish of cat biscuits, and an open gate are gift enough. Farther afield, camera traps in the conifer plantations have captured pine martens with kits in tow—heartening evidence that this elusive predator is reclaiming territory lost decades ago.

For stargazers, July’s Perseids have already sketched bright, silent punctuation across the night sky, but terrestrial fireworks continue in the hedgerows after dark. Glow-worms, actually beetles, dot verges with points of phosphorescent lime until mid-August. Conservation groups invite volunteers to log sightings on an online map, a crowd-sourced effort that helps pinpoint strongholds and monitor population shifts as roadside lighting expands.

On estuarine mudflats, the summer wader passage has begun. Curlew sandpipers and spotted redshanks pause just long enough to refuel before pressing north. Bird-ringing stations recorded an early influx of little stints this year; experts suspect favourable tailwinds over the Sahara. For coastal walkers, a lightweight scope and patience can turn a breezy afternoon into a catalogue of rarities edged in salt and song.

Closer to town, community orchards are thick with bumblebees. Buff-tailed and garden species crowd the lavender rows, while the rarer shrill carder—its high-pitched buzz unmistakable—has been reported in three new sites. Urban greening schemes, particularly green roofs and pollinator strips along tram lines, are credited for offering the nectar highway these insects need to expand.

Summer’s spell is fleeting, so field notebooks fill quickly. Botanists rush to verify reports of bee orchids along a motorway embankment; children sweep garden ponds for newt larvae, marveling at their external gills. Even the unassuming mole leaves evidence of industry, pushing fresh soil mounds overnight in the cricket grounds and reminding groundskeepers that subterranean life never truly rests.

Before autumn’s chill mutes the chorus, the countryside invites one more lingering listen. Whether you track swift silhouettes above market-town rooftops or study dragonfly wings by a reedy pool, each observation becomes a stitch in the broad tapestry of seasonal change—a record of how one summer looked, sounded, and shimmered in the moment we paused to see it.","Prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate a news article with the same title as the one you selected above.

Two killdeer are back on the grassy slope at the cemetery. They were gone for a long time after their nest beneath a small tree was raided. The abandoned nest still holds two eggs: one broken and one intact.

The female shivers while the male shows off the brilliant, fiery orange of his tail feathers, usually hidden from view. These are utilized in a ‘broken-wing’ display when threatened by an intruder, drawing attention away from the nest—a creative, instinctual response. 

Now they mate, the male flapping his wings vigorously for balance. They separate and preen. We have hopes for a new nest and potential offspring.

Canada geese gather in large groups on open grass near the river, as the adults have molted their wing feathers, which are scattered about, and the young are busy growing theirs. The grouping, open spaces and proximity to water are all protective adaptations, as they can see predators, escape to the water, and experience safety in numbers. 

All their flight feathers molt at the same time—an unusual trait that leaves them flightless for three to six weeks. I always excitedly await that first flight in late summer when they are free again, shouting out their raucous calls.

There are families at varying stages of development. Some juveniles have started to grow feathers, and some are still fluffy with that innocent eye peering out under a golden head. Some are still awkward ‘teens’, but all are intent on feeding. When they tire, they drop down onto grass, tarmac or into a river of water rushing down a hill during a sudden rainburst. They seem to grow very quickly, under the protective eye of the diligent parents. 

One day, from the car, I see a pair of swans at a dock on the Charles River. The massive male looks scruffy, whereas the more elegant female looks beautiful. Both rest on pale, wide feet—the male tucking his head under a wing, still watching me with one eye. She slips into the water, seeming to wait for him, but finally swims off slowly, as he readjusts his resting position. 

As the avian flu is rampant and deadly, I am concerned that he may be ill, as he is no longer in their usual territory for several days. The mate arrives at the dock with a small gaggle of geese around her. Over the next few days, she is seen swimming along the edge and taking cover behind small bushes, seemingly searching for him, now alone. Mute swans do mate for life, but can find a new partner after a loss.

Then, as we turn a corner to a river view, we see the pair together. The male looks fine, and they seem peaceful and idyllic together again. Nature is full of mysteries. We can only speculate. 

As we meander, a brilliant brown juvenile red-tailed hawk, its glorious spread tail caught in the light, swoops down from a stone to the ground and then flies close over our heads, carrying its young prey to a tall tree.

Early summer is filled with new life: birds fly up to their nests with full beaks to feed their young, tiny rabbits dart helter-skelter, and a symphony of cheeping calls fills the hot air.",https://lexobserver.org/2025/07/01/summer-sightings-a-nature-column/,real,0
"FCPA Discovery Trail celebrates 75 years of parks.

This year marks a major milestone for outdoor enthusiasts and history lovers alike as the Fairfax County Park Authority (FCPA) commemorates 75 years of preserving green spaces with the launch of the FCPA Discovery Trail — a county-wide celebration connecting people, parks, and the past.

The Discovery Trail is more than a scenic journey — it's a self-guided experience through 12 of the county’s most cherished parks, each one spotlighting a unique theme from Fairfax’s rich environmental, cultural, and recreational history. The trail encourages visitors of all ages to explore nature centers, historical landmarks, and family-friendly playgrounds while collecting stamps in a special anniversary trail passport.

“The Discovery Trail is our way of honoring the generations of residents, staff, and volunteers who’ve helped shape this incredible park system,” said Jai Cole, Executive Director of FCPA. “It’s also an invitation to the next generation to discover everything these parks have to offer.”

Participants who visit at least 8 of the 12 featured sites by August 31 will be entered into a prize drawing for bicycles, park passes, and other outdoor-themed giveaways. Each stop offers interactive exhibits and hands-on activities celebrating the diverse legacy of the county’s parks — from stewardship of native habitats to the stories of communities that called these lands home.

The 75th anniversary also includes a series of community events, nature walks, live music, and commemorative tree plantings throughout the summer. Local leaders credit the park system with not only preserving open spaces but also strengthening community identity and wellness.

Founded in 1950 with a mission to protect natural and cultural resources, the Fairfax County Park Authority has grown to manage more than 420 parks across 24,000 acres — one of the largest systems of its kind in the nation.

“The FCPA has always been more than just parks,” said Board of Supervisors Chairman Jeff McKay. “It’s about connection — to the land, to history, and to each other. This anniversary celebrates that legacy.”

The brochure highlights 12 of the fabulous parks located throughout the county.  Anyone who visits eight of the parks on the trail before Labor Day will win a prize package and be entered to win the grand prize.  

“The Discovery Trail map began in 2014 and has been a popular summer activity with families ever since. Each year, the Discovery Trail  Map has occurred, and a committee of Park Authority staff has chosen a theme,” said Jai Cole, executive director of the Fairfax County Park  Authority.  

The FCPA was founded on December 6, 1950. Ten years later, in 1960, there were only 20 parks under the FCPA umbrella.Today, that number has risen to 420.  

Every stop on the Discovery Trail is packed with fun and adventure.  This year, the theme celebrates the mission of FCPA to “connect our  community through nature, history, and play — 75 years strong.”  

“As the Fairfax County Park Authority celebrates its 75th Anniversary, participants will be able to explore the parks and learn about the history dating back thousands of years,” said Cole. “Today, the Park Authority is incorporating innovative solutions at sites to preserve parks for generations to come.”  

To get started on the Discovery Trail, head to any one of the 12 parks featured. There will be maps on site. Alternatively, you can visit the FCPA website and download the map directly from there. Then get ready to explore and learn about the history of Fairfax County.

"Three dead, 12 injured in Three Gorges accident! He revealed this incident happened on the same day and criticized: Taiwan's transportation system is sick..

New Taipei City — A tragic traffic accident occurred in New Taipei's Sanxia (Three Gorges) District earlier today, resulting in three deaths and 12 injuries. The incident involved a multi-vehicle collision on a busy road during peak hours, causing chaos and significant traffic congestion in the area.

According to initial reports from the New Taipei City Fire Department, emergency calls were received around 7:30 AM. Firefighters and paramedics were immediately dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, they found multiple vehicles— including a truck, a bus, and several private cars— severely damaged. Victims were trapped inside their vehicles, requiring the use of hydraulic tools for rescue.

Authorities confirmed that three people were pronounced dead on-site, while 12 others sustained injuries of varying degrees and were rushed to nearby hospitals for treatment. The cause of the accident is currently under investigation, with preliminary findings pointing to brake failure in one of the larger vehicles, which triggered the chain collision.

What drew additional attention was that this tragedy occurred on the same day as another serious road accident in central Taiwan, prompting public outrage over the state of transportation safety. Prominent commentator [Name Withheld] voiced sharp criticism on social media:

“Two major traffic accidents in one day? Taiwan’s transportation system is sick. This isn’t bad luck—this is systemic failure. Poor infrastructure planning and lax enforcement of vehicle inspections are killing people.”

Netizens echoed these sentiments, calling for stricter traffic safety regulations, mandatory vehicle maintenance checks, and better public transportation alternatives to reduce reliance on overloaded roads.

The New Taipei City Police Department stated that a full investigation is underway and that they will review road conditions and traffic management measures in the area. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications announced plans for an emergency meeting to address public concerns and explore solutions to prevent similar tragedies.","please generate a news article with the title: Three dead, 12 injured in Three Gorges accident!

"Three dead, 12 injured in Three Gorges accident! He revealed this incident happened on the same day and criticized: Taiwan's transportation system is sick..

A serious accident occurred near Beida Elementary School in Sanxia District, New Taipei City, this afternoon (the 19th). A 78-year-old man driving a car at the intersection of Guocheng Road and Guoguang Road struck a crowd at high speed for unknown reasons, resulting in three deaths and 12 injuries. In response, the popular online influencer ""Cheap,"" who regularly covers traffic issues, noted that on the same day as the accident, a group of people protested the Ministry of Transportation's ""Pedestrian Emperor Clause,"" slamming ""Taiwan's entire transportation system as being flawed.""
Regarding the serious traffic accident in Sanxia, ​​New Taipei City, Cheap revealed earlier on Facebook that a group of drivers went to the Ministry of Transportation this morning to protest, believing that ""pedestrians are emperors"" and the penalties are unfair. ""It's so funny. You can sit in a one-ton metal weapon, enjoy the air conditioning, pick your nose and scroll through your phone at the same time, and say that pedestrians walk slowly and are emperors. If pedestrian violations will cause the driver to become a vegetable, I absolutely support heavy penalties, but the reality is, you hold the steering wheel and step on the accelerator, but you still want to be less responsible than the person walking.""
He said frankly that he was not an ""emperor"" who was hit and killed while walking on the zebra crossing, and he also had to reflect on himself for walking too slowly. In the car accident this afternoon, more than 10 people were injured, including 12 schoolchildren in their teens. They were the little pedestrians who were described by protesters as ""walking like emperors."" ""Taiwan's entire transportation system is sick, and it is a serious problem. This is not an accident. It is the inevitable product of long-term laxity in the system, out-of-control driving culture, and lack of law enforcement.""
As for whether similar accidents can be prevented, Cheap believes that while individuals cannot prevent them, the country can, for example, by implementing regulations for elderly drivers, strengthening road design to protect pedestrians, and imposing heavier penalties for violations. ""Remember what the former Minister of Transportation said? 'The value of life and public discontent are a dilemma.' Taiwan's transportation system has no shortage of laws or budgets; what it lacks is the courage to put human life first.""",https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E4%B8%89%E5%B3%BD%E8%BB%8A%E7%A6%8D3%E6%AD%BB12%E5%82%B7-%E4%BB%96%E6%9B%9D%E5%90%8C-%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8A%E6%BC%94-%E9%80%99%E4%BB%B6%E4%BA%8B-%E7%97%9B%E6%89%B9-135154431.html,real,0
"Fire at North Potomac townhouses displaces two families.

Two North Potomac families are displaced after a fire engulfed their townhouses early Friday morning, according to Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service (MCFRS) Assistant Chief David Pazos.

MCFRS crews were dispatched to the 11900 block of Roan Lane for the report of a fire just after 5:30 a.m., Pazos said in a video on social media.

Responding firefighters encountered a large blaze at the rear of two adjacent three-story townhomes, according to Pazos. The fire, which engulfed the backside of the homes, had begun to spread to a third townhouse.

“Searches were quickly performed, all were negative, and all occupants were evacuated outside and uninjured,” Pazos said.
More than 60 firefighters were on scene to fight the blaze, MCFRS spokesperson Pete Piringer said in a social media post Friday morning.

In total, about 13 people were affected by the Friday morning fire, according to Pazos. Two families, which include five adults, five children and three pets, were displaced from their homes, Pazos said.

"Dressed as women, looted as men: Four held in Expressway robbery racket.

The Ahmedabad Rural Police have cracked a case of violent highway robbery that had sparked fear among truck drivers on the Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway. Four individuals were arrested after an extensive two-month investigation, during which the accused were found to have been involved in at least 14 robberies, using elaborate disguises and ambush tactics near toll plazas and secluded stretches of the highway.

According to officials from the Vivekanandanagar police station, on the night of May 30, 2025, a truck driver and his cleaner were attacked near the Geratnagar village, approximately one kilometre from the Ramol toll plaza. One of the accused, disguised as a woman, lured the truck off the highway under the pretext of seeking help. The moment the vehicle stopped, the driver and cleaner were dragged into the bushes, assaulted with hammers, and robbed of ₹25,000 in cash and approximately ₹24,000 worth of silver ornaments. The gang escaped into the darkness, leaving behind traumatised victims and little evidence.

Following the FIR lodged by Muljibhai Shadulbhai Bharwad, a resident of Borsad in Anand district, the police launched an intensive probe.

The investigation relied heavily on human intelligence, night patrolling, and technical surveillance. Over 70 mobile numbers were subjected to CDR (Call Detail Record) analysis. Sim cards, clothing remnants, and other trace evidence left by the suspects at previous crime scenes helped the team reconstruct their pattern.

The breakthrough came when a suspicious SIM card found at the crime scene led investigators to Devdi village in Daskroi taluka. There, after extensive surveillance, the police detained three suspects—Dineshbhai Wadi, Maheshbhai Wadi, and Devabhai alias Pemabhai Dhanabhai Nat. The fourth accused, Ajaybhai Pratapbhai, was arrested shortly afterwards.

The mastermind, Devabhai alias Pemabhai, was known to cross-dress as a woman to lure truck drivers, promising sexual favours. Once the driver was isolated, the other three accused would emerge from hiding and attack the victim with weapons before looting valuables.

Police officers, some disguised as decoys, even posed as drivers to replicate the setup and identify suspect movement near the highway. Based on eyewitness accounts and victim sketches, the gang was finally identified and nabbed. Three mobile phones were recovered from the accused’s residences, and ₹49,000 worth of cash and jewellery was seized.

During interrogation, the accused confessed to at least 14 such lootings, targeting truck drivers along isolated stretches. Police have since contacted past complainants and are matching the stolen property with reports filed from various districts, including Anand and Ahmedabad.

The four accused were produced before the court and have been remanded to police custody for further investigation. Officers said the gang had become so notorious that some truckers had begun avoiding night drives on the expressway.

Police said investigations are ongoing and more victims are being encouraged to come forward.",https://english.gujaratsamachar.com/news/gujarat/dressed-as-women-looted-as-men-four-held-in-expressway-robbery-racket,real,0
"Dressed as women, looted as men: Four held in Expressway robbery racket.

Mumbai, India — In a dramatic crackdown on a bizarre and brazen crime syndicate, police on Wednesday arrested four individuals accused of disguising themselves as women to rob unsuspecting motorists along the Mumbai-Pune Expressway.

The gang, operating under the guise of transgender women and cross-dressers, reportedly targeted lone drivers and small families traveling at night. Posing as stranded hitchhikers or offering blessings at roadside tolls and rest stops, the suspects allegedly gained victims’ trust before turning to violence and looting.

According to officials from the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch, the group had been under surveillance for over two weeks after multiple complaints of highway robberies involving ""unusual attire"" began to surface.

Modus Operandi Revealed

The accused — identified as Rakesh Pawar (32), Imran Sheikh (28), Mahesh Patil (35), and Sanjay Thakur (30) — would don sarees, wigs, heavy makeup, and imitation jewelry to pass off as women, mostly in the dark of night. Once they convinced their targets to stop or lower their guard, the group used knives, rods, or pepper spray to subdue them, before fleeing with cash, phones, and valuables.

“They were using the disguise as a psychological tactic,” said Assistant Commissioner of Police Sujata Rao. “Drivers are less likely to suspect women of violent crimes, which gave the gang a significant advantage. But their luck finally ran out.”

Crackdown and Confession

The breakthrough came after highway patrol officers flagged down a suspicious vehicle near Khalapur late Tuesday night. Inside were four men in women's clothing, carrying a stash of wallets, watches, and mobile phones that did not belong to them.

Upon questioning, the suspects reportedly confessed to at least six robberies over the past month, most occurring between midnight and 3 a.m. Forensic teams and surveillance footage have linked them to several open cases in Navi Mumbai and Lonavala.

Public Reactions and Police Advisory

The arrests have sparked shock and disbelief among locals and travelers who frequent the expressway.

“I can’t believe something like this was happening,” said Shruti Mehta, a Pune resident who uses the expressway weekly. “It’s scary to think a simple roadside interaction could turn into a robbery.”

Police have urged the public to remain cautious while driving at night and to avoid stopping for unknown individuals unless it’s an emergency. They are also working with toll operators to install better lighting and increase patrols in isolated stretches.

Further investigations are underway to determine if more individuals are involved in the racket. Authorities have not ruled out connections to larger criminal networks exploiting similar tactics across other highways.

“Unusual disguises won’t save criminals,” ACP Rao added. “We are committed to keeping our roads safe — no matter how cleverly the crime is dressed.”","Generate a news article for the title ""Dressed as women, looted as men: Four held in Expressway robbery racket""",fake,1
"A massive fire swept through a warehouse in Oakland Friday afternoon, spreading to at least one other building and vehicles on the street.  

The Oakland Fire Department said the fire was at four alarms as of 5 p.m. A large column of smoke billowed over the Melrose neighborhood of East Oakland, east of Interstate Highway 880 and west of San Leandro Street.

Some 75 firefighters were battling the fire at 5309 E. 8th Avenue, which is registered to a company called H&Q Furniture LLC. Oakland Fire Chief Damon Covington said the site was challenging as it was bordered by both commercial and residential buildings, along with multiple vehicles on the street.

""This easily could have been, you know, a two- or three-block fire if the crews really hadn't put a lot of pressure on the fire initially,"" said Covington.

Battalion Chief Porya Jeddi said an initial report from an Oakland police officer on the scene indicated there was a marijuana growing operation inside the facility after speaking with a woman who emerged from the burning building.

There was no immediate confirmation on what caused the fire or if there were any more people inside the building.

""It appeared that the female that was outside with OPD was inside, and they noted that the grow operation caused the fire,"" said Jeddi. ""That's the initial reports I got, it hasn't been confirmed.""

The fire, next to the railroad tracks, spread to an adjacent building and also burned at least three recreational vehicles parked on the street in front of the building.

Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said in a statement Friday evening that no injuries were reported and the fire is under control. .

Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said in a statement Friday evening that no injuries were reported and the fire is under control. .

A massive fire tore through a warehouse in East Oakland late Friday night, engulfing the building in flames and revealing what officials say was a large-scale, unlicensed marijuana cultivation site.

The fire broke out around 11:30 p.m. near the 800 block of 85th Avenue in the industrial corridor of East Oakland. Multiple callers reported heavy smoke and flames shooting from the structure. Oakland Fire Department crews arrived within minutes to find the building fully involved.

It took over 50 firefighters and nearly three hours to bring the fire under control. No injuries have been reported, but officials say the building is a total loss. Firefighters battled hazardous conditions, including dense smoke, electrical hazards, and concerns over potential chemical exposure due to the presence of grow lights, fertilizers, and extraction equipment.

During the initial response, firefighters reported unusual interior structures and heavy vegetation inside the warehouse. A subsequent investigation confirmed the building housed a sophisticated, but illegal, marijuana growing operation. Authorities said the site included hundreds of mature cannabis plants, irrigation systems, and industrial-strength lighting rigs.

""We're looking at a multi-room setup with substantial electrical modifications, most of which appear to be unpermitted,"" said Battalion Chief Renee Jackson of the Oakland Fire Department. ""This fire could have been much worse given the high load of combustibles and flammable materials inside.""

City officials said the warehouse was not registered with the state or city cannabis licensing agencies. Representatives from Oakland’s Cannabis Regulation Office and the California Department of Cannabis Control have been called in to investigate further.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation, though preliminary reports suggest an electrical malfunction may have sparked the blaze. Utility crews were on site early Saturday morning assessing damage to nearby power lines.

Neighbors said the building had been quiet for months, with occasional deliveries at odd hours. Some suspected activity inside but had no confirmation until now.

“I always thought something weird was going on in there,” said Malcolm Reyes, who lives two blocks away. “You’d see big trucks pulling in and out in the middle of the night, but no signs or anything. Now it makes sense.”

Officials say no arrests have been made, but the property owner and any operators found responsible could face charges related to illegal cannabis production, fire code violations, and potential environmental hazards.

This is the second fire in recent years in Oakland tied to unpermitted marijuana operations. In 2021, a similar blaze destroyed a West Oakland building and prompted a citywide crackdown on illegal grows.

The Oakland Fire Department and Oakland Police are continuing their joint investigation.","Could you generate an article based off of the following title:

"Health Dept: Additional Mosquito Samples Test Positive for West Nile Virus.

PITTSBURGH – The Allegheny County Health Department today announced additional mosquito samples have tested positive for West Nile Virus. Accordingly, the health department will treat areas for mosquitoes in the communities of Point Breeze, Regent Square, Edgewood, Wilkinsburg, East Hills, Homewood, and Highland Park with a pesticide called Zenivex E20. Zenivex E20 is classified by the EPA as low-risk and is not harmful to humans or pets.

Crews will use a truck-mounted Ultra Low Volume (ULV) sprayer on Wednesday, July 30, 2025, from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. to reduce the local mosquito population and minimize human transmission risk. If it rains on Wednesday, spraying will be postponed to Thursday, July 31, 2025, during the same hours.

West Nile Virus is the leading mosquito‑borne disease in the United States, transmitted to people through infected mosquito bites. Cases occur during mosquito season, which runs from spring through fall. The last reported human case of West Nile Virus in Allegheny County was in September 2024.

Most people infected with the virus do not feel sick. Only about one in five develop symptoms such as fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Less than one percent develop serious illness.

“Generally, the species of mosquitoes that carry West Nile Virus are active from dusk to dawn,” said Nicholas Baldauf, Vector Control Specialist at the Allegheny County Health Department. “To deter mosquito bites, we encourage people to use insect repellent on exposed skin or wear long sleeves and pants.”

There are no vaccines to prevent West Nile Virus nor medications to treat it. Residents who suspect they may have contracted the virus should see a healthcare provider.

“Residents play an important role in reducing the mosquito population,” Baldauf added. “Mosquitoes can breed in as little as half an inch of stagnant water. People should pay attention to potential breeding sites like stagnant water in tires, unused swimming pools, buckets, corrugated piping, and clogged gutters.”

Residents can report mosquito breeding sites—on private or public properties—to the Allegheny County Health Department’s Housing and Community Environment Program via an online form or by calling 412‑350‑4046.",https://www.alleghenycounty.us/News-Articles/Allegheny-County-Press-Releases/July-2025-Press-Releases/7-28-2025-Allegheny-County-Health-Department-Announces-Additional-Mosquito-Samples-Test-Positive-for-West-Nile-Virus-Seven-Neighborhoods-to-be-Sprayed-on-July-30th?,real,0
"Health Dept: Additional Mosquito Samples Test Positive for West Nile Virus.

The state health department announced today that multiple mosquito samples collected across the region have tested positive for the West Nile Virus, prompting officials to issue new health advisories and begin targeted response efforts.

According to spokesperson Carla Mendes, the affected mosquito populations were identified in both urban and suburban environments, with samples testing positive in neighborhoods near public parks, retention ponds, and areas with standing water. While no human cases have been reported yet, health officials emphasize that the presence of the virus in mosquitoes signals an increased risk for community transmission during the peak summer months.

In response, vector control teams will begin aerial and ground-based spraying in targeted zones over the next two weeks, using EPA-approved pesticides. Residents are urged to reduce standing water around their homes, use insect repellent, and limit outdoor activity during dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active.

“We want to be proactive, not reactive,” said Mendes. “We’re expanding our surveillance and doing everything we can to minimize risk to the public.”

The department is also distributing free mosquito repellent at community health centers and encouraging citizens to report areas of concern through a newly launched web portal.

West Nile Virus is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito and can cause symptoms ranging from mild fever to severe neurological complications in rare cases. Health officials stress that while most infections are asymptomatic, vulnerable populations such as older adults and those with weakened immune systems should take extra precautions.","Write a news article based only on this title:  ""Health Dept: Additional Mosquito Samples Test Positive for West Nile Virus""",fake,1
"From a “Local Specialty” to a “Major Industry”: Baicheng Mung Bean Annual Output Nears 50,000 Tons.

In 2007, Baicheng mung beans earned national recognition as a protected geographical indication (GI) product, thanks to their exceptional quality and long-standing cultivation history. Since then, Baicheng has become a representative major production area for mung beans in Jilin Province and across China. In recent years, through policy support, scientific innovation, and brand-driven operations, this “small specialty crop” has rapidly grown into a “large-scale industry.” By 2024, the total mung bean cultivation area in the city reached 436,800 mu (about 29,120 hectares), with an annual output of approximately 47,400 metric tons.

Recently, in the experimental fields of the Baicheng Academy of Agricultural Sciences, over a dozen workers were carefully sowing seeds. However, these were not ordinary mung beans—they were special breeding materials used for variety identification and crossbreeding trials. These plants carry the genetic legacy of Baicheng mung beans, which spans over a hundred years.

Wu Guofang, director of the Academy’s Edible Legume Research Division, explained that researchers closely observe characteristics such as plant shape, height, leaf type, grain size, color, and pod length. From the offspring, individuals exhibiting desirable traits—such as longer pods, larger or smaller seeds, and yellow, black, or pale green coloration—are selected for further generational breeding trials.

Baicheng is located in a prime agricultural zone within a semi-arid ecological region, with an impressive 2,900 hours of annual sunshine. The significant temperature difference between day and night contributes to the outstanding quality of its mung beans. The beans contain more than 26% protein and are known for their vibrant green sheen and pure aroma. Wu highlighted the exceptional performance of the popular cultivar Baivlü No. 9, which is widely grown in areas such as Tongyu, Taonan, Songyuan, and the Inner Mongolia cities of Tongliao and Chifeng. This variety has extremely low fat content (less than 1%). When planted without mulch, yields can reach about 2,200 jin (1,100 kg) per hectare, and with mulching techniques, yields per mu (667 square meters) can exceed 350 jin (175 kg).

The industrial development doesn’t stop there. In 2020, “Baicheng mung beans” were included in the first list of 100 mutually recognized GI products between China and the European Union. Leveraging this advantage, mung bean products centered around Baicheng have gained wide recognition in international markets. Brand building has also made significant strides. In 2021, “Baicheng mung beans” were awarded the title of one of “Jilin’s Top Ten Geographical Indications,” and the geographical indication protection demonstration zone was listed for establishment by the China National Intellectual Property Administration—marking a breakthrough for Baicheng in this domain and signaling a new stage of industrial and brand development.

Li Xue, deputy section chief of the Standards and Technology Division at the Baicheng Municipal Market Supervision Bureau, shared that in recent years, the bureau has collaborated with the city’s Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Quality Inspection Institute, and other departments to strictly regulate every link of the mung bean industry—from seed cultivation and field management to quality testing, product development, and export. These efforts support higher crop yields and increased farmer incomes. Authorities have also helped develop local standards for mung beans and guided qualified enterprises in using the special “Baicheng Mung Bean” GI label, ensuring that the national demonstration zone passes inspection smoothly.

From traditional farming to modern science, and from a local specialty to a national calling card, Baicheng mung beans embody both the perseverance of farmers and the wisdom of researchers. On this land connecting the Horqin Grassland and the Songnen Plain, a new generation of mung bean varieties is emerging from the rich black soil, continuing the legacy of this “emerald among beans.”",http://jkq.jlbc.gov.cn/zwgk/ywdt/202506/t20250609_1015048.html,real,0
"From a “Local Specialty” to a “Major Industry”: Baicheng Mung Bean Annual Output Nears 50,000 Tons.

Baicheng, China — Once regarded as a humble local specialty, the Baicheng mung bean has rapidly grown into a pillar of regional agriculture, with the city's annual output approaching 50,000 tons in 2024. This transformation marks a significant milestone for the mung bean industry, reflecting a broader shift toward agricultural modernization, brand development, and sustainable rural revitalization.

Baicheng, located in the northwestern region of Jilin Province, boasts an ideal climate and fertile soil that have long supported mung bean cultivation. However, it is only in recent years that the city has unlocked the crop’s full potential through a combination of scientific research, supportive policies, and strategic branding.

At the heart of this transformation is the Baicheng Agricultural Science Academy, where researchers are hard at work in experimental fields dedicated to mung bean breeding and hybridization. These test plots, covering several hectares, are used to evaluate new varieties for traits such as yield stability, pest resistance, and nutritional value. “Each plant carries the promise of the next generation of Baicheng mung beans,” said one lead researcher. “We’re not just growing crops — we’re preserving and evolving a regional legacy.”

Baicheng’s government has played a critical role in scaling the industry by offering subsidies, technical training for farmers, and incentives for enterprises to invest in processing and packaging. In addition, the establishment of cooperatives has allowed smallholders to participate in a larger value chain, boosting both productivity and income.

Efforts to protect and promote the brand have also paid off. “Baicheng Mung Bean” was granted Geographical Indication (GI) status in 2007, a designation that certifies its unique origin and quality. Since then, the product has gained nationwide recognition for its vibrant green color, soft texture, and health benefits, fueling demand in both domestic and international markets.

With over 430,000 mu (approximately 71,000 hectares) of mung bean fields cultivated in 2024, Baicheng now leads the province — and ranks among the top producers nationally. The city’s annual output of 47,400 tons is not only a testament to its agricultural strength but also a symbol of how a once-overlooked crop can drive local development and reshape an economy.

As Baicheng looks to the future, plans are already in motion to expand processing capacity, invest in value-added mung bean products, and explore e-commerce opportunities. What began as a local specialty has become a model for modern agricultural transformation — green, sustainable, and full of promise.","From a “Local Specialty” to a “Major Industry”: Baicheng Mung Bean Annual Output Nears 50,000 Tons based on the title given, write a news article, and do not cite any external sources",fake,1
"Coffee prices could increase at Pittsburgh-area shops due to tariffs.

Coffee lovers in the Steel City may soon find their daily brews a bit more bitter—not from the beans, but from their price tags.

Several local cafés across the Pittsburgh region are preparing to raise their coffee prices in response to a new round of tariffs imposed on imported agricultural goods, including green coffee beans. The tariffs, enacted earlier this month by the U.S. Department of Commerce as part of a broader trade realignment with South American nations, are expected to increase the cost of raw coffee beans by as much as 15%.

“We’ve already seen a 10% jump in bean prices from our Guatemalan and Colombian suppliers,” said Lily Tran, owner of Bloom & Bean in Lawrenceville. “We’re a small business—we can only absorb so much before it starts impacting our margins.”

Coffee importers say the tariffs are hitting smaller, specialty roasters hardest. While national chains often have multi-year contracts or diversified supply chains, many independent cafés rely on single-origin beans from a handful of producers.

“Tariffs of this kind create uncertainty across the supply chain,” said Mark O’Brien, a Pittsburgh-based importer and distributor. “We're trying to negotiate new deals, but there’s no quick fix when global prices shift overnight.”

The new tariffs stem from ongoing trade negotiations with Brazil and several Andean nations over agricultural subsidies and fair labor practices. Though not directly targeting coffee, the commodity has been caught in the crossfire.

Local customers are already bracing for a price hike. “If my $3.50 cappuccino becomes $4.25, that adds up fast,” said Oakland resident Jaylin Moore. “But I also get that these cafés are trying to stay afloat.”

Some shops are experimenting with cost-cutting strategies, including adjusting roast blends or reducing cup sizes. Others, like Hill District’s Unity Grounds, are using the moment to spotlight transparency.

“We’re letting our customers know exactly where their coffee comes from and why prices are changing,” said founder Rashad Coleman. “People are surprisingly understanding when you tell them the full story.”

Still, if tariffs persist, Pittsburgh’s beloved café culture may face a frothy future.

“We’ve been through supply shortages, inflation, and even a pandemic,” said Tran. “But coffee is essential here—come rain, snow, or trade war. We’ll adapt.”","Please generate a fake news article with the title as: ""Coffee prices could increase at Pittsburgh-area shops due to tariffs"". ",fake,1

Coffee prices could soon increase at Pittsburgh-area shops due to tariffs on imported coffee beans. 

Proudly serving fresh, made-from-scratch food, Jamie Pikulsky said she opened From Scratch Uniontown with deep roots connected to her family. 

""My grandmother, my mother, we never went out to eat when I was younger, ever,"" Pikulsky said. ""We always had dinner at home around the table, and everything was made from scratch. Even our soup here, we make the noodles from scratch. All the cookies are from scratch.""

She said since opening in 2022, her goal has been to drive business with quality and prices.

""I want to keep our prices affordable,"" Pikulsky said. ""We're in Fayette County. There's a lot of low-income people around here. I want it to be less expensive than the corporate coffee chains to draw people in.""

But she said over the past several months, tariffs on coffee beans have significantly increased her costs. 

""Our coffee price is up about $1.56 a pound,"" Pikulsky said. ""So, we buy in 5-pound bags. So, that really adds up. It probably brings our coffee price up about $150 a week. So, $600 a month.""

Pikulsky said there's also a shortage of coffee syrups, forcing From Scratch Uniontown to switch brands, limiting options on flavors. 

""We keep about 80 flavors on hand,"" Pikulsky said. ""We're going to have to try to narrow that down, probably to 20, until this gets better.""

She added that she's not alone. Pikulsky said this is impacting several businesses across the region. 

""It's tough,"" she said. ""I don't know of any small business right now that is thriving. It's tough across the board.""

Despite it all, she said raising prices will be a last resort, but Pikulsky fears how much longer she'll stay afloat without more sales or relief on the cost of goods. 

""It's scary because this is my life,"" Pikulsky said. ""This isn't just a job for me. I was a school teacher for almost 20 years, and I stopped doing that to do this. I have a lot invested in this.""

She said if she does raise prices, it could be from 25 cents to 50 cents, depending on the item. ",https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/coffee-prices-tariffs-what-does-it-mean/?intcid=CNR-01-0623,real,0

"Dublin Leprechauns leave Vallejo Seaweed in the dust.

The Dublin Leprechauns don’t find gold at the end of a rainbow — they find it at home plate.

And on Monday night, the Leprechauns hit the jackpot. 

Dublin blasted the Vallejo Seaweed 13-3 behind a red-hot 15-hit performance. The Leprechauns improved to 31-17-1, while Vallejo fell to 15-34. 

With only five games remaining, the Seaweed are officially out of the playoff picture. Vallejo head coach Christian Carmouche said the Seaweed are now focused on playing spoiler. 

“Now we get to play devil’s advocate,” Carmouche said. “We get to kind of mess up the rankings by getting wins and that’s what we’re trying to do.” 

But unlike LeSean McCoy spoiling “Avengers: Endgame” in 2019, Vallejo was unable to ruin Dublin.

The trouble began in the top of the first inning, when the Leprechauns tallied three runs on five hits and one walk. 

The Seaweed struggled to find their rhythm until the bottom of the fourth, when Bryce Hayman beat out a chopper to the pitcher’s mound. After Hayman stole second base, Steven Matchan drove him home with a single to right. 

Dublin’s cleanup hitter Donnie Gardiner responded with a no-doubt two-run blast to left in the top of the fifth, giving the Leprechauns a 5-1 advantage they never looked back from. 

Vallejo had runners on the corners in the bottom of the fifth, but Dublin elected to intentionally walk Brendan Hillis, bringing up starting pitcher Matt Lazcano, who grounded out to end the inning. 

“I think it was just the approaches today,” Carmouche said. “Today was more of a mental game and the mental just wasn’t there.” 

Lazcano surrendered nine hits and five earned runs in five innings, while relief pitcher Andrew Espinoza gave up six hits and five earned runs in four innings. 

Vallejo’s defense didn’t do its pitching any favors. The Seaweed committed five errors, with two of their mostly costly mistakes coming consecutively in the the top of the seventh. 

After Espinoza mishandled a hard-hit grounder, he rifled a throw over first baseman Andrew Mason’s head, allowing Victor Ceniceros to advance to third. During the next at-bat, Charlie Bogue hit a broken-bat grounder that was misplayed by third baseman Jacob Savoy, allowing Ceniceros to score. 

“A lot of snowball fights today,” Carmouche said. “We threw the ball around a lot.” Dublin relief pitcher Dante Hatchett closed out the victory after inducing a double play. Gordon Wend took home the win, striking out eight batters while allowing six hits and three earned runs in 8.1 innings. 

The Seaweed were scheduled to face Martinez on Tuesday. They will return to Wilson Park for their final homestand of the season on Thursday and Friday. 

“We’re gonna fight,” Carmouche said. “We’re just gonna continue to compete and try to mess up the race.”",https://www.thereporter.com/2025/07/22/dublin-leprechauns-leave-vallejo-seaweed-in-the-dust/,real,0
"Dublin Leprechauns leave Vallejo Seaweed in the dust.

July 23, 2025 | Dublin, CA — In a dazzling display of speed, strategy, and sheer grit, the Dublin Leprechauns trounced the Vallejo Seaweed last night with a commanding 9-2 victory that sent shockwaves through the Pacific Independent Baseball League.

Fans packed the Shamrock Stadium, and they weren’t disappointed. The Leprechauns wasted no time asserting dominance—scoring four runs in the first two innings, capitalizing on Vallejo’s early pitching woes. Leprechauns shortstop Danny “Blitz” McKenna was unstoppable at the plate, going 4-for-5 with two doubles, a triple, and three RBIs.

“This was personal,” McKenna said post-game. “They took us down in Vallejo last month. We weren’t going to let that happen on our turf.”

The Seaweed, known for their unorthodox tactics and slow, grinding playstyle, were left floundering as Dublin’s defense locked down the infield with military precision. Starter Miguel Torres pitched six scoreless innings, striking out seven and walking none, keeping Vallejo’s batters guessing with a devastating slider.

“Torres was painting corners like Picasso out there,” said Leprechauns manager Sheila O’Doyle. “This was our most complete game of the season.”

Vallejo’s lone highlight came in the 7th, when slugger Jerome “Kelp King” Watkins knocked a two-run homer into the right-field bleachers—but by then, the damage was done.

The win pushes Dublin to the top of the North Division standings and secures their sixth consecutive home victory, cementing their reputation as the league’s surprise powerhouse of the summer.

“Call it luck, call it hard work—but tonight, the Leprechauns made their magic real,” a grinning O’Doyle said as green and gold confetti rained down from the rafters.

The teams will face off again next weekend in Vallejo, where the Seaweed will look to reclaim some pride and douse the flames of Dublin’s red-hot run.","Generate a news articel with this title: ""Dublin Leprechauns leave Vallejo Seaweed in the dust"" ",fake,1
"Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Integrated Circuits team has made breakthrough progress in the field of high-speed optical interconnection in data centers.

Focusing on core technology bottlenecks
Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Integrated Circuits team has made breakthrough progress in the field of high-speed optical interconnection in data centers
July 28, 2025 Editor: Zhang Yue
Recently, Professor Li Yu, the team of Professor Zhou Linjie of the School of Integrated Circuits (School of Information and Electronic Engineering) of Shanghai Jiaotong University, and the team of Professor Zhuge Qunbi and the Huawei team have made breakthrough progress in the field of high-speed optical interconnection in data centers. For the first time, a 4×256 Gbps silicon-based high-speed transmitter with on-chip adaptive dispersion compensation function was realized. The chirp of the MZM modulated signal was adjusted by integrating an adjustable splitter in front of the silicon-based Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) to achieve adaptive compensation for fiber dispersion, solving the core technical bottleneck that restricts the development of high-speed optical communications. This technology provides a promising solution for optical interconnection in next-generation data centers and high-performance computing, strongly supports the deployment of future 1.6Tbps WDM systems, greatly improves the transmission distance of high-speed modulated signals, and lays a key technical foundation for the development of global data centers towards ultra-high speed and ultra-large capacity.

The chip is manufactured based on the mature 8-inch silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process and has excellent large-scale production potential and industrialization prospects. The relevant research results were published in Nature Communications under the title ""A 4×256 Gbps silicon transmitter with on-chip adaptive dispersion compensation"".

Research background

Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology significantly improves the total bandwidth of optical modules through multi-wavelength parallel transmission, but as the edge wavelengths in WDM systems gradually deviate from the zero-dispersion wavelength point of optical fibers and the single-wave modulation rate increases rapidly, fiber dispersion has become the core bottleneck restricting the development of high-speed optical communications. This challenge is particularly prominent in optical communication systems based on coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM): the single-mode fiber dispersion coefficient at the 1271 nm operating wavelength reaches -2.36 to -4.96 ps/nm/km, which severely limits the transmission distance of modulated signals. In the single-wavelength 100 Gbps 400GBASE-LR4-6 application, the transmission distance of the modulated signal at the wavelength of 1271 nm is only 6 km; in the single-wavelength 200 Gbps 800GBASE-FR application, the transmission distance is further shortened to 2 km. Faced with this technical bottleneck, the IEEE 802.3dj specification under development was forced to abandon the CWDM solution and instead adopt 8 low dispersion coefficient wavelengths in the LAN-WDM solution to achieve 10 km transmission of a single-wavelength 200 Gbps signal. However, with the explosive growth of communication capacity demand, the limited number of channels within the low dispersion coefficient wavelength range will not be able to meet future needs, and effective dispersion compensation for high-dispersion wavelengths has become a key technical problem that the industry needs to solve urgently.

Innovative results

Schematic diagram and working principle of a transmitter with dispersion compensation function

In response to this core pain point of the industry, this work pioneered and successfully implemented a silicon-based MZM transmitter with adaptive dispersion compensation function (Figure 1), providing a revolutionary technical solution to solve the bottleneck of optical communication transmission. The transmitter innovatively integrates an adjustable splitter composed of a 1✖2 Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), achieving the industry's first technical breakthrough in precisely controlling the chirp characteristics of the output signal by simply adjusting the ratio of the upper and lower input optical powers of the MZM, and can dynamically generate a pre-chirped modulated signal that perfectly matches the fiber dispersion characteristics. Experimental verification shows that this breakthrough solution achieves continuous and precise adjustment of the MZM small signal chirp parameters in the range of [-1,1], perfectly meeting the stringent requirements of dispersion compensation in O-band WDM systems. More importantly, at a high-dispersion operating wavelength of 1271nm with a fiber dispersion coefficient of up to -3.99 ps/nm/km, the silicon-based optical transmitter developed in this work successfully achieved 5 km transmission of 4-channel 256 Gbps PAM-4 signals and 10 km transmission of 4-channel 200 Gbps PAM-4 signals without the need for high-power pre-emphasis processing, with bit error rates better than the forward error correction (FEC) hard decision threshold of 6.7% overhead (Figure 2).

Transmitter's 4-channel 256 Gbps PAM-4 transmission results

The device has the ability to compensate for the dispersion of the entire 1271-1340 nm band, providing a low-power, highly compatible core optoelectronic device solution for the next generation of 1.6 Tbps data center optical interconnection. It not only breaks through the transmission distance limitation of the traditional CWDM system, but also makes full use of limited spectral resources and lays a solid foundation for the industrial application of ultra-high-speed optical communication technology. This technological innovation has important industrial promotion value and broad application prospects, and will provide key technical support for the sustainable development of global data centers and optical communication industries.

"Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Integrated Circuits team has made breakthrough progress in the field of high-speed optical interconnection in data centers.

Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Integrated Circuits team has made breakthrough progress in the field of high-speed optical interconnection in data centers
In the current era where data volume is experiencing explosive growth, the demand for high-speed and efficient data transmission within data centers has surged to an unprecedented level. Facing this critical challenge, the research team from the School of Integrated Circuits at Shanghai Jiaotong University has recently achieved significant breakthroughs in the field of high-speed optical interconnection for data centers, which is expected to bring about a transformative impact on the operation mode of global data centers.
With the rapid advancement of digital transformation across various industries, data centers are confronted with an overwhelming surge in data traffic. The emergence and rapid development of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and cloud computing have further intensified this trend. Traditional copper-based interconnection technologies are gradually approaching their inherent limits in terms of bandwidth, latency, and energy efficiency, making high-speed optical interconnection an increasingly indispensable and superior alternative. Optical fiber, by virtue of its unique physical properties, can realize ultra-high-speed data transmission with lower power consumption over longer distances, perfectly meeting the high-density and high-performance operational requirements of modern data centers.
The research team of the School of Integrated Circuits at Shanghai Jiaotong University has long been committed to in-depth research on key technologies of high-speed optical interconnection, and has made a series of groundbreaking achievements through persistent exploration and innovation.
In the aspect of advanced optical modulation technology, the team has successfully developed a set of innovative optical modulation techniques, which have significantly enhanced the data-carrying capacity of optical signals. By skillfully applying advanced coding and modulation schemes, the team has broken through the traditional bottlenecks of data transmission rates. Specifically, they have conducted in-depth optimization on the Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) technique, successfully achieving higher-order modulation formats. This technological advancement has resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of data transmitted per unit time over a single optical fiber. A large number of experimental data have verified that the net data rate has been improved by a remarkable margin, and it is expected to reach a speed level that was previously considered unattainable in practical data center application scenarios.
Another major research focus of the team lies in chip-level integration technology. They have independently designed and successfully fabricated a new generation of photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which integrate multiple optical functions onto a single chip. This innovative design not only effectively reduces the size and structural complexity of optical transceivers but also significantly improves their overall performance and energy efficiency. Through the precise miniaturization of optical components, the team has successfully increased the port density, enabling more high-speed connections to be established within limited spatial conditions. This is of crucial practical significance for data centers, where space resources have always been in short supply. Meanwhile, the integrated chips developed by the team also exhibit excellent low-power consumption characteristics, which can effectively alleviate the huge energy pressure faced by data center operations.
In addition, the research team has also made important progress in the optimization of fiber-optic transmission performance. They have carried out extensive and in-depth research on new types of optical fibers, and have developed a series of optimized fiber-optic cable solutions specifically for the complex operating environment of data centers. By comprehensively improving the key physical properties of optical fibers, such as reducing attenuation and chromatic dispersion, the effective transmission distance of optical signals has been significantly extended. This technological breakthrough allows data to be transmitted over longer distances within the data center without significant degradation in signal quality, providing strong technical support for the construction of more flexible and efficient data center architectures.
The series of breakthroughs achieved by the research team of the School of Integrated Circuits at Shanghai Jiaotong University will undoubtedly have a profound and far-reaching impact on the global data center industry. In terms of performance enhancement, the significant improvement in data transmission rate and signal quality will enable data centers to process massive amounts of data more efficiently. This will directly translate into faster response speeds for cloud services, more powerful computing capabilities for artificial intelligence and big data analysis applications, and a comprehensively upgraded user experience for services relying on data centers, including online gaming, high-definition video streaming, and e-commerce platforms.
In terms of cost efficiency, the reduction in power consumption of the new technology and the increase in chip port density will bring substantial cost savings to data center operations. Lower power consumption directly leads to a significant reduction in energy bills, while the higher port density allows more connections to be realized with fewer components, thereby reducing hardware procurement and maintenance costs. Furthermore, the extension of transmission distance may also reduce the demand for complex and expensive signal-boosting equipment within data centers, further optimizing the overall operational cost structure.
Looking to the future, as data traffic continues to grow at an exponential rate, the innovative achievements in high-speed optical interconnection technology by the Shanghai Jiaotong University team will provide a solid technical foundation for data centers to cope with future challenges, ensuring that they can smoothly adapt to the development of emerging technologies and new application scenarios in the long term.
The team stated that they will continue to deepen the refinement and upgrading of related technologies and actively explore broader application fields. At the same time, they plan to strengthen cooperation with leading enterprises in the industry to promote the commercialization of research results and accelerate the process of applying these high-speed optical interconnection solutions to the market. In addition, the team will also expand research directions in related fields, such as developing more advanced optical modulation techniques and exploring the application potential of new materials in optical components. With their unremitting efforts and persistent pursuit of technological innovation, the team is poised to play a leading role in shaping the future development of high-speed optical interconnection in data centers, both domestically and internationally, making important contributions to the advancement of global information and communication technologies.

"Map shows how much snow Pittsburgh area will get, starting during Friday evening's commute.

PITTSBURGH — As winter weather makes its way across Pennsylvania, residents in the Pittsburgh area should brace for snow starting during Friday evening’s commute. A new forecast map released by the National Weather Service (NWS) details how much snow is expected across the region, with accumulations varying significantly by location.

According to the NWS, the first flakes will begin falling around 5 p.m., coinciding with rush hour. The heaviest snowfall is expected between 7 p.m. and midnight, creating potentially hazardous driving conditions. Road crews are already preparing to treat major thoroughfares, but officials urge commuters to leave work early if possible or use public transportation to avoid the worst of the storm.

Accumulation Forecast

The snowfall map indicates:

Pittsburgh City Proper: 2-4 inches

Northern Suburbs (Cranberry, Wexford): 3-5 inches

Southern Suburbs (Bethel Park, Upper St. Clair): 2-3 inches

Eastern Suburbs (Monroeville, Murrysville): 3-4 inches

Western Areas (Moon, Robinson): 2-4 inches

Higher Elevations (Laurel Highlands): 5-8 inches

Meteorologists explain that the higher snow totals in the Laurel Highlands are due to the area’s elevation and colder temperatures, which allow for more snow to accumulate.

Impact on the Commute

The timing of the snowstorm couldn’t be worse for evening commuters. ""This storm is expected to create slippery roads and reduced visibility,"" said Rachel Harper, a meteorologist with the NWS. ""Drivers should allow extra time to reach their destination and keep a safe distance from other vehicles.""

PennDOT has activated its winter weather response plan, deploying salt trucks and plows to keep roads as clear as possible. However, officials warn that untreated secondary roads may become especially treacherous.

Weekend Weather Outlook

The snow is expected to taper off by early Saturday morning, leaving behind a fresh blanket of snow. Temperatures on Saturday will hover in the mid-20s, keeping the snow in place through the weekend. Residents planning outdoor activities or holiday shopping are advised to bundle up and proceed with caution.

As always, stay tuned to local weather updates for the latest information and prepare your vehicle with an emergency kit in case of delays.

"All music fans across the country flocked together to witness a four-hour ""Xiao's Marathon""! The 2024-2025 season of the Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra came to a close. .

Every July during the peak summer season, the music seasons of major symphony orchestras across the country come to an end one after another. On the evening of July 20th, the closing ceremony of the 2024-2025 music season of the Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra presented a super strong lineup of Chinese performing artists of great strength in the international classical music scene - cellist Qin Liwei, Chen Yibao, violinist Ning Feng, Zhou Ying, pianist Du Peida, and Yan Siqi. They performed a ""Shostakovich Marathon"" for a full four hours, becoming the Deservedly known as the ""King of Scrolls""” of this round of the closing season.

From dusk to night， this was the third concert of the ""Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Shostakovich's Death"" series of this music season， and it was also the most significant one. ""A night with an excessive amount of Shostakovich"" required both length and difficulty. From piano， violin to cello， and even the most unique ""piano and trumpet"" concerto， the Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra showed absolute sincerity and boldness.
This extraordinary milestone night saw professional music fans from Beijing， Shanghai， Guangzhou and all over the country gather in Hangzhou. There were those dragging suitcases， those exchanging ""no-cost (meaning free and without compensation) peripheral products""， and those squatting at the entrance of the cast and crew to wait for the artists. The heat was no less than that of a star-studded concert.

The first highlight of the night belonged to Chen Yibao， Du Peida and Yan Siqi， the three ""00s"" superstars. The young cellist Chen Yibao， a winner of many international top-level competitions， performed the G major second cello concerto with the bow. It had the sharpness and confrontation of ""old Shostakovich"" music， while also incorporating the rationality and youthful invincibility of the German-Austrian school. The young pianist Du Peida， who hadn't seen each other for two years， suddenly transformed into an adult. He brought the F major second piano concerto， still with full grains of precise playing and rapid forward momentum， making people dream back to the moment when Liu Xiaoyu， who won the Chopin International Piano Competition， shocked the world. The Canadian-Chinese pianist Yan Siqi was the first to visit Hangzhou. He and the trumpet deputy chief He Hanyun jointly challenged the highly exploratory c minor first piano concerto. His performance was full of exuberant personality and powerful vitality， forming a wonderful dialogue and competition with the sharp and brilliant sound of the trumpet.

Such an extraordinary night saw the return of old friends of the Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra. As the backbone of the Chinese classical music scene， violinist Ning Feng and cellist Qin Liwei appeared on the stage together. Ning Feng chose Shostakovich's B flat major second violin concerto. This was undoubtedly the most difficult and obscure of the six concerto pieces， but Ning Feng's perfect performance of the musician and instrument integration amazed many fans， ""with an impact that exceeded any recording"". Qin Liwei's main performance of the E flat major first cello concerto was still calm and romantic， especially the handling of the cadenza， full of emotion and brilliance， shining brightly.
The ""Harvard girl"" violinist Zhou Ying， who made her grand entrance at the end， was another big surprise of the night. Her tone was clean and crisp， her emotions were passionate and unrestrained， and the final note released the passion that ignited the entire audience. The orchestra also burst with final strength， marking the end of this ""Crazy Night"" closing concert with a magnificent conclusion.

Looking back on this music season， the Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra used ""eternity"" as the axis， with 20 music season concerts， 4 chamber music performances and many popular music concerts to invite global art experts to share the city's classical feast.
Not long ago， the new art committee of the Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra was established. Artists like Yu Long， Wang Jian， Wu Man and Zhou Tian joined， marking that the orchestra would move to a new height.

In the hot summer sky， the orchestra will bid farewell to the audience temporarily and meet again in the theater when the autumn wind passes by. In the next music season， we look forward to the passionate collision of Western and Eastern notes， the shining appearance of ""The Twilight of the Gods"" from ""Nibelungen Ring""， and the dazzling debut of world-class art masters.

"All music fans across the country flocked together to witness a four-hour ""Xiao's Marathon""! The 2024-2025 season of the Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra came to a close. .

HANGZHOU, China – In an extraordinary testament to artistic ambition and audience devotion, the Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra (HPO) brought its 2024-2025 season to a thunderous close over the weekend with a monumental event dubbed ""Xiao's Marathon."" True to its name, the four-hour musical odyssey, conceived and led by the orchestra's acclaimed Music Director, Yang Yang (affectionately known as ""Xiao Yang""), saw music lovers from across China flock to Hangzhou's Grand Theatre, filling the venue to capacity.
The marathon concert, unprecedented in its scale for the orchestra and a rarity in the Chinese classical music scene, was designed as a crowning achievement for the season. It served as a powerful showcase for the HPO's technical prowess and stamina under Yang Yang's dynamic leadership, which has propelled the orchestra to national prominence.
""The 'Marathon' was born from a desire to push boundaries, both for the orchestra and our audience,"" explained Maestro Yang Yang before the performance. ""It's a celebration of the monumental works of the late-Romantic era, a test of collective endurance, and ultimately, a shared, profound musical journey. We wanted to conclude our season not just with a concert, but with an event.""

The program lived up to the marathon billing, strategically structured to offer peaks and valleys of intensity. The first half featured Gustav Mahler's expansive and emotionally charged Symphony No. 1 ""Titan"", allowing the orchestra's rich string sections and powerful brass to establish the epic tone. Following an intermission, the orchestra plunged into the vast sonic landscapes of Richard Strauss's ""Eine Alpenf sinfonie"" (An Alpine Symphony), a tone poem demanding immense orchestral forces to depict a day's journey through the mountains, complete with off-stage brass, wind machine, and thunder sheet. The combined duration of these two monumental works naturally stretched towards the four-hour mark, including the interval.

Audience members, many having traveled specifically for the event, prepared for the long haul with a mix of excitement and determination. The atmosphere was electric, charged with anticipation for the shared challenge and musical reward.
""Seeing the 'Marathon' advertised, I knew I had to come from Beijing,"" said Li Wei, a devoted classical music fan. ""It's not just about the length, it's about experiencing these incredible works back-to-back under Xiao Yang's baton. The energy in the hall was incredible – you could feel everyone committing to the journey together.""
The performance itself was met with critical and audience acclaim. Reviewers highlighted the orchestra's remarkable focus and sustained power throughout the demanding program, particularly praising the nuanced handling of the Alpine Symphony's complex textures and dramatic shifts. Yang Yang's control over the vast architectural scope of both works was consistently noted.

As the final, haunting notes of the Alpine Symphony's ""Night"" faded, the audience erupted into a prolonged, thunderous standing ovation that lasted several minutes. The exhaustion from the musical journey was palpable, but utterly eclipsed by the exhilaration and awe of the shared experience.

The success of ""Xiao's Marathon"" serves as a resounding finale to what the HPO has described as one of its most successful and artistically adventurous seasons. It underscores Hangzhou's growing stature as a major hub for high-caliber classical music in China and the magnetic pull of Maestro Yang Yang's artistic vision. The event also demonstrated a significant and passionate appetite among Chinese audiences for immersive, demanding cultural experiences, setting a high bar as the orchestra looks ahead to planning its next season. The ""Marathon"" wasn't just a concert; it was a landmark moment for the orchestra and its devoted national following.

"Redmond Police Department Proud to Honor 6-Year-Old Della as ""Chief for a Day"".

Redmond, WA – August 25, 2025 — The Redmond Police Department rolled out the red carpet for a very special guest this week: six-year-old Della, who took on the role of “Chief for a Day” as part of an annual tradition celebrating children battling serious medical conditions.

The event, organized in partnership with local hospitals and law enforcement agencies, gives young patients a chance to experience the joy of public service while creating lasting memories for their families. For Della, whose courage has inspired many, it was a day filled with smiles, sirens, and heartfelt community support.

Dressed in a custom-sized police uniform and official badge, Della began her morning with a formal swearing-in ceremony led by Police Chief Darrell Lowe. “Today, we welcome Chief Della to the team,” Lowe said during the ceremony. “Her strength, optimism, and leadership remind us what true courage looks like.”

After taking her oath, Della climbed aboard a patrol car for a special escort through Redmond. Along the route, officers, firefighters, and city employees lined the streets, waving signs and cheering as the young “chief” passed by. The convoy stopped at City Hall, where Mayor Angela Birney personally congratulated Della and presented her with a proclamation declaring it “Chief Della Day” in Redmond.

The celebration didn’t stop there. Della toured the police station, explored emergency vehicles, and even helped “solve” a staged case set up by detectives. Her favorite moment? Turning on the siren and announcing, “Chief Della on duty!” over the loudspeaker.

For Della’s family, the experience was priceless. “This means the world to us,” said her mother. “She’s been through so much, and to see her light up like this—it’s a day we’ll never forget.”

The “Chief for a Day” program highlights the deep connections between law enforcement and the communities they serve. It’s designed not only to celebrate these remarkable children but also to give them a chance to dream big beyond the challenges they face.

“Della is part of our family now,” Chief Lowe added. “She has the heart of a leader, and today, she showed us all what bravery truly looks like.”

As the day came to a close, Della received an honorary plaque, her very own badge, and a promise: the Redmond Police Department will always have her back.

For one extraordinary day, Redmond’s youngest chief inspired an entire city—and reminded everyone that heroes come in all sizes.","Can you generate a news article with the title ""Redmond Police Department Proud to Honor 6-Year-Old Della as ""Chief for a Day"""", and keep the article within 500 words?",fake,1
"Redmond Police Department Proud to Honor 6-Year-Old Della as ""Chief for a Day"".

The Redmond Police Department is proud to announce its participation in the 2025 Chief for a Day program, a statewide initiative dedicated to celebrating the lives of children diagnosed with life-threatening or chronic medical conditions.

Organized by the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission (WSCJTC), the Chief for a Day program recognizes the resilience, courage, and strength of these extraordinary children by making them honorary police chiefs or sheriffs for a day.

Each child receives a personalized police uniform, an official badge, a motorcade escort, interactive demonstrations from law enforcement agencies, and is honored in a formal public ceremony, creating a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the child and their family.

This year, the Redmond Police Department is honored to introduce Della, a spunky six-year-old, as our 2025 Chief for a Day. Della loves the color pink, unicorns, horses, and everything related to Barbie and dolls. Her energy, imagination, and joy are contagious.

Della lives with Xeroderma Pigmentosum Cockayne Syndrome Complex (XP-CS), a rare and complex genetic disorder with only 43 documented cases worldwide. XP-CS presents life-altering challenges, including extreme sensitivity to sunlight and an elevated risk of skin cancer. Despite these daily obstacles, which include wearing UV-protective gear and undergoing regular medical care, Della continues to embrace each day with unwavering strength and optimism.

“Della’s spirit and resilience are truly an inspiration and reflect the values we admire most in our community,” said Chief Darrell Lowe. “We are beyond thrilled to have her join the department as our Chief for a Day and can’t wait to see the positive energy she brings to our team.”

The 2025 Chief for a Day celebration will be held on Thursday, August 28, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., at the WSCJTC campus in Burien, WA. Della will be celebrated alongside children from 16 law enforcement agencies across the state.

To support Della and help create lasting memories, the department is accepting donations through the Redmond Police Benevolent Fund. Contributions will help offset medical expenses and provide experiences tailored to Della’s interests and needs, like horseback riding, trips to her favorite indoor play center, and UV-protective gear.

"Largest dinosaur exhibition ever held in Singapore to open at Science Centre in October.

SINGAPORE – The largest dinosaur exhibition ever held in Singapore will open on Oct 11 at the Science Centre Singapore.

First announced at the NUS Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum’s (LKCNHM) 10th anniversary event on May 6, the exhibition comprises two sections – Dinosaurs of Patagonia and Six Extinctions.

The dinosaur showcase will include 33 fossils and 60 full-scale models, and unfold across three interactive zones.

Jointly organised by the Science Centre and LKCNHM, it will be held at the annexe halls of the Science Centre.

Visitors can look forward to journeying through 400 million years of Earth’s history, brought to life across 3,000 sq m of exhibition space.

The exhibition will shed light on the rise and fall of prehistoric life, and the five major extinction events in the planet’s history.

The first showcase, Dinosaurs of Patagonia, was curated by Museo Paleontologico Egidio Feruglio, a paleontology museum in Argentina. Here, visitors can step into ancient Patagonia – which is one of the Earth’s most fertile fossil grounds today.

Its centrepiece is a 40-metre life-sized cast of the Patagotitan mayorum, which belongs to a group of dinosaurs called titanosaurs. At 70 tonnes each, they were some of the largest dinosaurs and land animals to roam the Earth. Twelve other dinosaur species will also be featured.

The second showcase, named Six Extinctions, is curated by Australia-based Gondwana Studios. Over 30 fossils, including Scotty, the largest Tyrannosaurus rex ever found, will be on display.

The exhibition concludes with a display on Earth’s sixth extinction that is unfolding in the present day, where guests will be prompted to ponder humanity’s impact on biodiversity.

The museum has also drawn from its own collection to highlight Singapore’s biodiversity challenges. Species on display include the cream-coloured giant squirrel (Ratufa affinis affinis) and the rufous-collared kingfisher (Actenoides concretus), which are both now extinct nationwide.

This exhibit will also showcase scientific methods and analytical tools currently employed to study extinction records, which may help to predict and prevent the loss of more species in the future.

For Singaporeans and permanent residents, tickets are priced at $25.90 for children and $29.90 for adults. For standard admission, tickets are priced at $39.90 for adults and $35.90 for children.

"Pickett Fire: Napa County wildfire grows slightly as crews battle for containment.

The Pickett Fire in Napa County grew by just over 270 acres to 6,803 acres overnight Saturday into Sunday, with containment slightly increased at 13%.

The fire broke out Thursday afternoon off the 2300 block of Pickett Road, in an unincorporated area north of Calistoga.

Evacuation orders for zone NPA-E120, which covers North of Silverado Trail, South of Pickett Road, East of Rosedale Road, and West of Pickett Road, were reduced to evacuation warnings Sunday at 3 p.m. Anyone considering returning should be prepared to leave again if the orders change. 

Zone POP-E001A, West of Butts Canyon, North of Pope Valley Rd, and East of Aetna Springs Lane was also reduced to an evacuation warning at that time. 

An evacuation center at the Calistoga Community Center will be closed Sunday at 3:30 p.m., according to the county's Office of Emergency Services.

Both zones are restricted to residents only, according to the Napa County Office of Emergency Services, the director of which, Ryan Alsop, who is also Napa County's Chief Executive Officer, signed a formal emergency proclamation Sunday meant to speed recovery efforts and potentially unlock state and federal resources. 

Evacuation zones can be found by clicking the ""Genasys Project"" link on the county's emergency alerts webpage at https://www.readynapacounty.gov/462/Genasys-Protect-Zonehaven.

Containment was still at 11% as of 3:30 p.m. The fire remained within Cal Fire's established control lines and was behaving as expected as it burned in rugged terrain with a varying rate of spread, which had been slowed to moderate overnight into Sunday with the help of a nocturnal aerial assault by five helicopters.

"Pickett Fire: Napa County wildfire grows slightly as crews battle for containment.

Firefighters continued to battle the Pickett Fire in northern Napa County on Monday as the blaze grew slightly overnight, fueled by dry vegetation and shifting winds. While crews made modest progress on containment, officials remain concerned about the potential for flare-ups in the coming days.
As of Monday morning, the Pickett Fire had burned approximately 1,320 acres, up from 1,200 acres the night before, according to Cal Fire. Containment remained at 35%, with more than 400 personnel working around the clock to establish and reinforce fire lines.
🔥 Cause Under Investigation
The fire broke out on Saturday afternoon near Pickett Road, north of Calistoga, in a region already under heightened fire watch due to extreme heat and low humidity. The cause remains under investigation, though officials have not ruled out human activity.
🌬️ Challenging Conditions Persist
Over the weekend, gusty winds and hot, dry conditions pushed the fire into rugged, hard-to-access terrain, complicating containment efforts. Cal Fire spokesperson Maria Lopez said crews are working both from the ground and air, using helicopters and air tankers to slow the fire's progress.
“We’ve seen some improvement on the western flank,” Lopez said. “But with changing wind directions and hot spots flaring up, we’re not out of the woods yet.”
🏠 Evacuations and Road Closures
Evacuation orders remain in effect for several rural neighborhoods north of Calistoga, including parts of Pickett Road, Tubbs Lane, and Kortum Canyon. As of Monday, over 100 homes remained under mandatory evacuation, with additional areas under evacuation warnings.
The Napa County Sheriff’s Office has closed sections of Highway 29 and surrounding rural roads, urging residents to avoid the area and follow official alerts.
🐴 Livestock and Wildlife at Risk
Ranchers and animal rescue groups have mobilized to evacuate livestock and horses from threatened areas. Wildlife officials also report sightings of displaced deer and small mammals near the fire perimeter, a stark reminder of the fire's impact on the local ecosystem.
🌲 Fire Season Outlook
The Pickett Fire is one of several fires currently burning across Northern California, as the state enters the peak of its wildfire season. Prolonged drought, combined with record heat, has left vegetation dangerously dry, creating ideal conditions for fast-spreading fires.
📢 What’s Next
Cal Fire says additional crews and equipment are being deployed as officials aim to increase containment over the next 48 hours. A cooling trend expected later this week could offer some relief, but fire officials are urging continued caution.
“Our crews are doing everything they can to protect lives and property,” said Incident Commander Chris Matthis. “But we need the public’s help in staying clear of evacuation zones and reducing ignition risks elsewhere.”
Residents are encouraged to monitor evacuation updates via Nixle alerts, Cal Fire social media, and local emergency services.","generate an article that has the title ""Pickett Fire: Napa County wildfire grows slightly as crews battle for containment""",fake,1
"Mars library commissions fundraising study for new building..

The Mars Area Public Library reached out to a nonprofit consulting firm to assess the fundraising potential for its relocation and new building, which is still in the planning stages.

Mark Lynch, of the firm Mark J. Lynch and Associates, presented the results of his fundraising feasibility study to members of Mars borough council during their meeting on Monday night, July 21.

“The library and I touched base about three months ago concerning their proposed relocation,” Lynch said. “So what I proposed is a feasibility study to assess the fundraising potential for the library and Mars discovery center.”

The object of the study, according to Lynch, is to identify sources of potential fundraising, as the project is estimated to run into the millions of dollars once the first shovel starts turning.

“Typically, these are four to five month projects,” Lynch said. “They involve face-to-face interviews with members of the community, civic leaders and business people. The idea is to meet with people whose financial support for the project can help you to be successful.”

Lynch said he and the library are aiming particularly at big-ticket donors who would be willing to make five- and six-digit financial gifts.

“The entire community will have an opportunity to participate and all giving levels are important,” Lynch said. “But the purpose of the study is to really focus on the people with the highest capacity, whether they're individuals or families or businesses or charity foundations. And we’re going to look at government grants.”

The combined library/discovery center project was initially unveiled in May 2024 as a joint venture between Mars and Adams Township. The most recent plans are to build a new library on the site where a NexTier Bank, formerly Mars Bank, currently stands on Main Street in Mars. The new library would include a “discovery center” with assistance and exhibits from NASA.

"Mars library commissions fundraising study for new building..

Mars borough officials announced this week that the Mars Area Public Library has initiated a fundraising feasibility study to gauge community support and identify potential large donors for a proposed new library and discovery center.

Library board president Karen Mitchell described the study as the first structured step toward a multi-million-dollar project to relocate the library to a Main Street property that would also host a hands-on “discovery center.” “We want to ensure this project is sustainable and that it serves everyone in our community — children, seniors and area visitors,” Mitchell said.

Consultant Mark Lynch, who is conducting the study on behalf of the library, told council members Monday that the work will include interviews with community leaders, local businesses and potential major donors. Lynch said the study is designed to determine realistic fundraising targets and identify the kinds of naming and sponsorship opportunities that would attract five- and six-figure commitments.

“The survey and interviews give us a clear picture of the resources available in the community and among regional foundations,” Lynch said. “Once we complete that, we’ll be able to advise on achievable campaign goals and a timeline.”

Town residents at the meeting expressed cautious optimism. Local business owner Maria Torres said a new library could be a boon for downtown foot traffic and educational programming. “If it brings more families to Main Street, that helps everybody,” she said.

The proposed site for the new building was identified earlier this year as the former bank parcel on Main Street. Plans discussed by the library and Adams Township include an interactive space with exhibits developed in partnership with science organizations, expanded children’s programming, and flexible meeting spaces for local groups.

If the feasibility study indicates strong donor interest, library officials say they will begin developing a formal capital campaign strategy and seek matching grants from state and federal programs. “We’re approaching this carefully,” Mitchell said. “We want to be good stewards of donations and ensure the project benefits all residents.”

Council members emphasized that no final decision or funding commitment has been made; the feasibility study is a planning step that will inform next steps. The library anticipates completing the study and reporting back to the borough within the next few months.","Write a neutral, factual local news article (about 250–400 words) under the title: Mars library commissions fundraising study for new building.

"Month past customary date, no sign of annual book festival in Thanjavur.

THANJAVUR — More than a month after the traditional January dates when thousands of book lovers typically descend upon this historic Tamil Nadu city, organizers and vendors remain tight-lipped about the fate of Thanjavur's beloved annual book festival.
The event, which has drawn literary enthusiasts from across South India for over two decades, usually transforms the grounds near the Brihadeeswarar Temple into a bustling marketplace of Tamil literature, academic texts, and regional publications during the third week of January.

Local booksellers report growing concern among the literary community, particularly given the festival's significance as a platform for regional authors and small publishing houses. The event typically features book launches, author readings, and cultural programs alongside commercial book sales.
S. Priya, who runs a Tamil literature bookshop in the city's main bazaar, noted unusual quiet from festival organizers. ""Usually by December, they're already reaching out to vendors and finalizing arrangements. This year has been different.""
The Thanjavur District Collector's office, which provides administrative support for the festival, declined to comment on specific dates but indicated that planning discussions are ongoing.
Festival coordinator R. Selvakumar could not be reached for comment despite multiple attempts over the past week.
The delay has raised questions about funding and logistics, though some speculate that organizers may be planning a larger event later in the year to coincide with the city's cultural calendar.
For now, book enthusiasts who made the annual pilgrimage to Thanjavur in January returned home empty-handed, leaving many wondering if the literary tradition will continue in 2025.
The festival's uncertain status represents a significant cultural loss for a region where the event has become synonymous with celebrating Tamil literary heritage and fostering reading culture among younger generations.","Write a news-style article with the title: ""Month past customary date, no sign of annual book festival in Thanjavur.""",fake,1
"Month past customary date, no sign of annual book festival in Thanjavur.

THANJAVUR: With the month of July, when the district administration’s Thanjavur Book Festival usually is organised, having long passed, book lovers in Thanjavur and surrounding areas express concern over the prospects of the eighth edition of the annual fair taking place at all this year. While there were annual book fairs organised in the past in Thanjavur by various organisations like Rotary clubs, it was in 2015 that the district administration organised its first Thanjavur Book Festival in collaboration with the Booksellers and Publishers Association of South India (Bapasi).

Thereafter the book fair was an annual affair at the palace complex in the city, except during 2020 to 2022 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. While the first edition of the book fair in 2015 was held in June, it was held in July from the subsequent year. There, however, has been no word on the eighth edition of the book fair till date, complain book lovers. ""Those who could not visit Chennai for the annual book fair held during December to January used to buy the new titles in the fair held in July. Moreover the authors from the district are also eager to display their works in a dedicated stall that was provided for them during last year's book fair,"" said N Premasayee, a writer from Tiruvaiyaru.

The fair used to be a place where college and school students picked up the habit of buying books, he added. When contacted, SK Murugan, the secretary of Bapasi, said he had approached the district administration thrice this year for dates for organising the book fair. ""They said they will get back,"" he added. When enquired, district administration officials said discussions on organising the fair is under way and that the dates are yet to be finalised. Discreet inquiries, however, revealed that there are concerns over the budget for the fair.

""The cost of setting up the main venue to accommodate the 100-odd book stalls will run into more than Rs 40 lakh. Besides, there will be expenses incurred while organising special literary programmes every day in a separate pandal,"" said an official who was part of organising the book festival in the past. Another official, however, remarked, “We used to organise the fair when there was no funding by the state government. Now the government allocates Rs 25 lakh every year. With the contribution from sponsors, the fair could be organised effectively.""",https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2025/Aug/25/month-past-customary-date-no-sign-of-annual-book-festival-in-thanjavur,real,0

"Decomposing Body Found In Rancho Palos Verdes, Investigation Underway.

Rancho Palos Verdes, CA — A grim discovery has left the community of Rancho Palos Verdes reeling after a decomposing body was found in a secluded area of the city on Thursday afternoon. Authorities are actively investigating the circumstances surrounding the case.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department confirmed that the body was located by a hiker around 2:30 PM in a remote section of the Portuguese Bend Reserve, a popular hiking and nature preserve. The hiker reported a foul odor, which led to the discovery of human remains partially concealed by vegetation.

Detectives and forensic teams were dispatched to the scene shortly after the report was made. Officials have cordoned off the area as they work to identify the deceased and gather evidence. “At this stage, we’re treating this as a suspicious death,” said Detective Maria Alvarez during a press briefing. “Our priority is determining the identity of the individual and understanding the events that led to their death.”

The condition of the body suggests it had been at the site for several days, making immediate identification challenging. Authorities are relying on dental records, fingerprints, and DNA analysis to confirm the identity.

The cause of death has not been determined, and the body will undergo a thorough examination by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office. Detectives are also reviewing missing persons reports from surrounding areas to aid in their investigation.

Residents expressed shock and concern following the discovery. “It’s unsettling to know something like this happened so close to home,” said local resident Julia Carter. “This is normally such a peaceful and safe place.”

The City of Rancho Palos Verdes and the Sheriff’s Department are urging anyone with information about the case to come forward. Tips can be provided anonymously through Crime Stoppers or by contacting the Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau directly.

Authorities emphasized that the investigation is in its early stages and have not ruled out any possibilities, including foul play or accidental death. As detectives continue their work, the community is left grappling with the unsettling discovery in their otherwise tranquil city.","Create a news article with the title ""Decomposing Body Found In Rancho Palos Verdes, Investigation Underway""",fake,1
"Man pleads guilty, sentenced to prison for stealing veteran’s car with his dog Lucky still inside.

A Pittsburgh man was sentenced to four years in state prison after pleading guilty to stealing a U.S. Army veteran’s car while the veteran’s service dog, Lucky, was still inside.

Prosecutors said the incident occurred last October when the man spotted the unlocked vehicle outside a grocery store and drove off. The car belonged to retired Staff Sergeant Michael Turner, who had left his Labrador retriever, Lucky, briefly inside while picking up medication.

Police launched a citywide alert within hours, with concern mounting for Lucky’s safety. The dog was located unharmed two days later, wandering near an abandoned lot, after neighbors reported hearing barking. The stolen car was recovered a short distance away.

In court, Turner told the judge that Lucky was more than a pet—he was his companion after deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. “I can replace a car,” Turner said, “but not Lucky. He’s my family.”

The judge handed down the sentence on Monday, emphasizing the emotional toll of the crime. “This was not just auto theft,” the judge said. “It was an act that put at risk the wellbeing of a veteran’s service animal.”

"Peddapalli: Intermediate student escapes from college, traced later.

Peddapalli, July 23 – In a dramatic turn of events, an intermediate student who reportedly ran away from his college in Peddapalli district on Tuesday was successfully traced and reunited with his family later that evening.

The student, a 17-year-old boy enrolled in a private junior college, allegedly walked out of the campus during the lunch break without informing college authorities or his classmates. The incident sparked panic among his parents and the college management, prompting an immediate search operation.

According to sources, the boy had been reportedly under stress due to academic pressure. His absence was noticed when the afternoon session began, and a search of the premises yielded no results. The college administration quickly alerted the local police and informed his parents.

Police officials from the Peddapalli Town station coordinated with the boy’s friends and tracked his phone's last known location. With the help of CCTV footage from nearby shops and transport hubs, they were able to identify his direction of travel.

“He was found near the Kazipet railway station around 7 PM. He had reportedly planned to travel to Hyderabad but changed his mind midway,” said a police officer involved in the search.

The student was safely brought back to Peddapalli the same night. Authorities stated that no harm had come to him during the incident. The boy has since been counseled and is currently with his parents.

The incident has raised questions about student well-being and the pressure faced by teenagers in competitive academic environments. The college management has promised to strengthen supervision protocols and provide additional mental health support to students going forward.

Local education officials are also reviewing the case to ensure such incidents are not repeated.

"Tuna season off to a good start.

The Atlantic bluefin tuna season is off to a promising start this year, with early reports from local fishermen and regulators pointing to strong catches, stable prices, and favorable weather conditions.

Commercial fleets out of Gloucester, Cape Cod, and Long Island reported solid landings in the first two weeks of the season. While daily quotas limit the number of fish that can be kept, fishermen say they are encountering large schools of tuna offshore, many of them in prime condition.

“This is the best opening I’ve seen in years,” said captain Mike Ferraro, who brought in two giant tuna during his first trip. “The fish are healthy, thick with fat, and moving closer to shore, which cuts down on fuel costs.”

On the market side, buyers are showing strong demand both domestically and overseas. High-grade bluefin, particularly those rich in marbling prized for sushi, are fetching upwards of $25 per pound at auction, with some fish bound for Tokyo commanding even higher prices.

Local restaurants are also benefiting. “We’ve been able to feature fresh tuna on the menu nightly,” said chef Laura Ng of Boston’s Seaport District. “Customers are thrilled to see it back in season.”

State and federal officials emphasized that the season’s early success comes within the framework of strict quotas aimed at preserving tuna stocks. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed that current catch levels are on track to remain sustainable.

“Fishermen are finding fish, and at the same time, our conservation measures are being respected,” said NOAA spokesperson Daniel Ruiz. “It’s a balance we’ve worked hard to achieve.”

Beyond the docks and auction houses, a good tuna season ripples through coastal economies. Charter boat operators report full bookings, and fuel docks, ice suppliers, and local markets all see boosts from the activity.

“It brings energy back to the waterfront,” said Gloucester harbormaster Sarah O’Malley. “A strong tuna season means work, income, and a sense of tradition carried forward.”

While the season is still young, fishermen remain optimistic. If weather patterns hold and fish remain abundant, the 2025 season could be one of the strongest in recent memory.

“Every season is a gamble,” Ferraro reflected. “But right now, all the signs are pointing in the right direction.”","Create a realistic news article that has the following title: ""Tuna season off to a good start""",fake,1
"Tuna season off to a good start.

The early start to the 2025 tuna season has fishers feeling optimistic about the rest of the season, as 26 per cent of quota has already been landed.

The season began on July 1, two weeks earlier than last year, said Bobby Jenkins president of PEI Fisherman’s Association, noting this year’s quota is similar to last year, which was around 146 tonnes.

“Usually our peak season is in September but it can start this month as well,” Jenkins said.

North lake fisher Tony MacDonald said his season has been steady so far.

He only started fishing last week and he’s already caught his first tuna. He expects the rest of the season to be fruitful.

MacDonald who has been fishing for 30 years said, it looks like this season is on par with last year.

Jason Tompkins has been in the tuna trade since 2000. He buys from local fishers including MacDonald. 

The early start has been good for fishers, Tompkins said. 

“So far we’ve been able to get good quality fishes from East Point to Tignish,” Tompkins said noting the tuna seem to be spread out throughout the Gulf  this year.

He exports the catches to 14 different countries.

Less than 1 per cent of tuna is sold on the Island. Around 30 to 40 per cent are exported to Japan, 30 to 40 per cent to Europe and around 20 to 30 per cent is exported to the rest of North America, he said.

Red head Harbour fisher Peter Drake said, this season has been decent so far.

“I’ve already caught a fish earlier in the season, last year I caught my first in September,” Drake said.

Another reason this season has been better for Drake is because his first fish last year had a shark  bite and the second fish was also injured so he didnt get a good price.

Jenkins, who fishes out of Annandale, has not seen any shark bites himself this year and he’s also landed a fish already.

Normally licensed fishers get two tags every season, however in September the quotas are re-shuffled depending on how many tuna have been caught. And after the Mexican season is over, a portion of its quota is also transferred to PEI.

“We will be receiving Mexican quota this year, but we don’t know how much or when it will be announced yet,” Jenkins added.

When Tompkins started the business 25 years ago, about 80 to 90 per cent of tuna was exported to Japan for sushi. Now, the younger generation does not consume as much sushi as the older generation, he said.

However, the dish’s popularity started growing in western countries, so he had to diversify his market.

He said the on-going Air Canada flight attendants’ strike is hurting his business, since 80 per cent of his products are exported through Air Canada. However, he has been looking into alternative routes.

“We have to roll with the punches and figure out other options,” he added.

He said the business has not been affected by the US tariffs since Canadian seafood exports have not been tariffed yet.

MacDonald hopes the remainder of the season will be smooth sailing.

“Hopefully people can catch some fish and make a dollar or two,” he added.",https://www.peicanada.com/eastern_graphic/tuna-season-off-to-a-good-start/article_2d0ba650-afc1-4951-8489-818c5e293552.html,real,0
"Brighton has country’s third lowest fertility rate.

Brighton & Hove — Brighton and Hove is recording one of the lowest fertility rates in the country, ranking third from the bottom among local authority areas, according to compiled local indicators and demographic patterns. While the city remains a magnet for young adults, its birth rate continues to trail the national average—underscoring long‑running urban trends shaped by housing costs, later family formation, and a high share of students and service‑sector workers.

What the ranking means
“Third lowest” refers to Brighton and Hove’s estimated total fertility rate (TFR)—the average number of children a woman is expected to have over her lifetime based on current age‑specific birth rates. A TFR below the national level has been a feature of Britain’s largest cities for years, and Brighton’s position near the bottom of the table places it alongside other dense, high‑cost urban areas where many residents postpone parenthood or opt for smaller families.

Why Brighton skews lower

High housing and childcare costs. Rents and starter‑home prices in popular coastal neighbourhoods make upsizing difficult, especially for first‑time parents. Families that do have children often look beyond the city for more space per pound.

Later family formation. Brighton’s economy draws graduates and early‑career professionals who frequently delay having children while they build careers or continue education.

A large student and young‑adult population. Universities and the creative sector bring in residents who are below peak child‑bearing ages, pulling the city’s overall rate down.

Flexible household types and lifestyles. The city’s diverse household structures—single‑adult households, co‑living, and couples without children—are over‑represented compared with the national picture.

Accessibility of reproductive healthcare. Good access to contraception and family planning typically lowers unintended births, which can reduce the TFR even as it improves health outcomes.

Local impacts already visible

Primary school enrolment. Several primaries have faced smaller intake cohorts, prompting discussions about class amalgamations or catchment tweaks to keep schools viable.

Maternity and early‑years services. With fewer births, services may need to reconfigure around continuity of care and targeted support rather than pure volume.

Labour market and housing mix. A lower birth rate can slightly ease pressure on the most family‑sized rentals while increasing demand for one‑ and two‑bed homes. Over time, a smaller cohort of local children feeds into a tighter pipeline of apprentices and entry‑level workers unless offset by in‑migration.

Council finances. Shifting demographics can change funding allocations tied to pupil numbers and early‑years provision, even as adult‑social‑care pressures grow with an ageing population.

How Brighton compares
Urban coastal hubs across England often cluster at the bottom of fertility rankings, while some suburban and commuter belts—where larger homes are more attainable and average ages are slightly higher—tend to sit above the national average. Brighton’s position near the bottom is therefore less an outlier than a continuation of a familiar urban pattern, magnified by the city’s popularity among students, creatives, and hospitality workers.

Policy levers being discussed elsewhere
Local authorities facing similar trends have explored measures that Brighton and Hove could consider or scale up:

Affordable childcare: Expanding nursery places and wraparound care to cut effective costs for working parents.

Family‑sized housing: Encouraging delivery of 2–3 bedroom homes in mixed‑tenure schemes and ensuring planning policies don’t skew too heavily toward micro‑units.

Transport and pram‑friendly streets: Better bus frequency, step‑free access, and safe routes to parks and schools reduce the “friction” of urban parenting.

Targeted health support: Pre‑conception counselling, fertility services, and perinatal mental‑health support can improve outcomes even if they don’t directly lift the TFR.

Flexible work and local jobs: Partnering with major employers on hybrid schedules and family‑friendly policies makes staying in the city with young children more feasible.

What to watch next

Net migration of families. Are new parents leaving for surrounding districts at higher rates, or is improved childcare keeping them local longer?

School planning. Will falling entry cohorts trigger mergers or repurposing of school buildings in the next few years?

Housing pipeline. The balance of studio/one‑bed flats versus larger units in upcoming developments will shape who can stay through different life stages.

Age structure. Brighton’s draw for twenty‑somethings remains strong; whether that translates to later‑life family formation in the city will depend on affordability and services.

Data note
Total fertility rate (TFR) is a synthetic measure that can move even if the number of women of child‑bearing age changes, or if births are postponed (tempo effects). Small shifts in age‑specific rates, migration, or registration practices can nudge local rankings year to year, so a single year’s position should be interpreted with caution.","Generate me a news article with this title: ""Brighton has country’s third lowest fertility rate"" Do not use the web.",fake,1
"Brighton has country’s third lowest fertility rate.

Brighton and Hove has the third lowest fertility rate in England and Wales, figures released today show.

The rate – defined as the average number of live children women would expect to have across their childbearing life – has dropped from 0.98 in 2023 to 0.97 in 2024.

The total fertility rate across England and Wales is at 1.41, down from 1.42 the previous year. This is the lowest since comparable data began in 1938, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

However, although the number has fallen, Brighton’s rate compared to other places has remained much the same over the last 20 years, rarely falling out of the top ten – and having fallen from second lowest in 2022.

For a country’s population to remain stable over time – discounting any impact from migration – the total fertility rate needs to be around 2.1.

The drop in the rate comes despite the number of births in England and Wales increasing slightly last year from 591,072 to 594,677.

But this was offset by a jump in the size of the overall population, meaning fertility rates fell overall.

The figures come just a day after Scotland’s total fertility rate was also confirmed to have dropped to a new record low, falling from 1.27 in 2023 to 1.25 in 2024.

The latest rate for Northern Ireland is due to be published later this year.

Greg Ceely, ONS head of population health monitoring, said: “Fertility rates in England and Wales have been in overall decline since 2010.

“The total number of births increased last year, for the first time since 2021, but this was offset by population growth.

“As a result, fertility rates fell overall, and are now at the lowest rates on record.”

The ONS figures show that the West Midlands had the highest regional fertility rate in 2024, at 1.59, while south-west England had the lowest (1.31).

Most regions saw a drop in the total fertility rate, with only two – London and the West Midlands – seeing a year-on-year increase.

At a local authority level, Luton in Bedfordshire had the highest total fertility rate in 2024 (2.00 children per woman), followed by Barking and Dagenham in London (1.99), Slough in Berkshire (1.96) and Sandwell in the West Midlands (1.91).

The City of London had the lowest rate (0.32), followed by Cambridge (0.95), Brighton and Hove in East Sussex (0.97) and Islington in London (0.99).

Newport had the highest local rate in Wales (1.64) while Cardiff had the lowest (1.19).",https://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2025/08/27/brighton-has-countrys-third-lowest-fertility-rate/,real,0
"PHOTOS: South Korean Soccer Superstar Son Heung-min Scores First MLS Goal in Dallas.

Korean-born soccer superstar Son Heung-min made his Dallas debut on Saturday evening and didn’t disappoint. The night hosted the most frenzied international excitement FC Dallas has been a part of since August 2023, when all-time great hero Lionel Messi played against the home team shortly after joining CF Miami. Before recently joining LAFC, Son had been one of the premier goal scorers in the English Premier League, the world's toughest soccer league.

Just five minutes in, Son converted a penalty kick from well outside the 18-yard box, lifting it over the wall of Dallas defenders and into the upper left corner of the goal, where it drove directly into the Apple TV net camera. The camera hadn’t even stopped shaking when MLS broadcast voice Nate Bukaty screamed, “The fans got what they came for here in Dallas!” Yes, they sure did.

In 2023, the city of Dallas designated a 1.5-mile stretch of Royal Lane in northwest Dallas as Koreatown for the next decade. But for at least one night, that designation might have moved about 20 miles north to Toyota Stadium in Frisco. Lines were forming well before gates opened, and fans were settling into sun-bleached seats way too early for a match in late August. They brought their kids, they brought their signs and jerseys, and capped it all with a huge helping of Korean pride. And whatever available seats didn’t get snapped up by the Korean community were quickly snared by fans of Tottenham Hotspur, Son’s former EPL club.

They cheered when he came in for warmups, cheered when he stood for pregame ceremonies, gasped whenever he touched the ball in the game, and swarmed the area around the player’s tunnel at the end of the night.

"PHOTOS: South Korean Soccer Superstar Son Heung-min Scores First MLS Goal in Dallas.

In a breathtaking display of class and precision, South Korean superstar Son Heung-min netted his first-ever MLS goal, marking a memorable milestone for both himself and Los Angeles FC (LAFC). The moment came in a high-stakes clash against FC Dallas at Toyota Stadium, culminating in a dramatic 1–1 draw.
A Free Kick “Like Magic”
Just six minutes into his third MLS appearance, Son unleashed a curling free kick from the edge of the penalty arc that soared into the top corner—beyond the reach of Dallas keeper Michael Collodi. The strike drew immediate comparisons to legendary “Yashin Zone” finishes for its pinpoint accuracy and audacity 

The goal came after a series of strong early impressions in MLS: he previously earned a penalty in his debut match against Chicago, then notched his first assist in LAFC’s 2–0 victory over the New England Revolution 

“Hang It in the Louvre”
Teammate Nkosi Tafari aptly summed up the moment:
“Hang it in the Louvre! First game he drew a penalty, second he got an assist and then got a goal... he could score this, and it went just in the top corner like magic.”
It was a sentiment echoed across the league—a breathtaking introduction to MLS excellence 

Game Overview
After Son’s early free kick, FC Dallas responded quickly. In the 13th minute, rookie Logan Farrington leveled the score—a strike from open play following an assist by Patrickson Delgado 

Despite LAFC’s sustained pressure in the second half, the teams remained deadlocked, finishing the match at 1–1. The result left both sides searching for more as the season progresses 

Reflecting post-match, Son was gracious yet focused:
“I'm glad I scored the first goal for the MLS and also for LAFC. But for me, the most important thing is to get us three points. I’m really, really disappointed for that.”

Coach Steve Cherundolo added, “He’s a competitor... a much-needed breath of fresh air… pushing us.” Indeed, Son’s early contributions have helped cap off an unbeaten stretch and keep LAFC securely positioned in the Western Conference playoff hunt

The Encore Awaits
The buzz ramps up as Son prepares for his home debut next weekend at BMO Stadium against San Diego FC. LAFC fans are already anticipating a peak performance on home soil, eager to see more magic from their record-signing star

The rally comes after more than 200 residents of the former Penn Plaza apartments were evicted when developer LG Reality Advisers decided in 2015 to tear down the building and replace it with an office and retail space that includes a Whole Foods Market. Those displaced included several from low-income units.

Demonstrators at the rally held signs calling for housing solutions for the low-income residents in the city. 

Mayor Ed Gainey and City Councilman ​​Khari Mosley were in attendance alongside former Penn Plaza residents and advocates.

Randall Taylor, a former resident and organizer of the anniversary rally, said he remains devastated by the memory of what occurred a decade ago.

“It’s heartbreaking every time you think about the situation,” he said. “It was one of the worst things in my life watching that happen.”

Mr. Taylor, who hasn’t set foot in the Whole Foods Market that was built on the property, said he had to move numerous times following his eviction from Penn Plaza.

O’Harold Hoots, another former Penn Plaza resident, said he had to move three times before finding another place that was suitable to live.

“It was such an injustice that so many people were evicted from their homes … please don’t ever forget that housing matters,” he said.

During the rally, a moment of silence was held for former Penn Plaza residents Mabel Duffy and Myrtle Stern, who became prominent housing advocates in wake of the evictions at the building, but have since died.

The two former residents were notably photographed on a couch in the middle of Penn and Centre avenues during a “living room” protest, during which furniture was brought into the intersection.

“Ms. Mabel was never able to move back to the city, though she wanted to, but Ms. Mabel, we were able to find her nice housing her,” Mr. Taylor said. “People did die in this situation.”

For some, the rally brought back some difficult emotions, including for Crystal Jennings-Rivera, the daughter of a former Penn Plaza resident and director of stewardship and community engagement at the City of Bridges Community Land Trust.

Ms. Jennings-Rivera reached out to displaced residents to see if they would like to move back to the area into Mellon’s Orchard South on North Beatty Street after the developer agreed to reserve some of the apartment units created as part of the project in 2021.

“It’s not easy to mobilize people,” she said. “It’s not easy to move people. It’s hard work.”

Throughout the rally, demonstrators called for the City Council to pass inclusionary zoning, which requires larger developments to make a percentage of those units affordable to tenants who make less than 50% of the area median income, or about $40,500 for a family of two.

Inclusionary zoning already exists in certain parts of the city, including Lawrenceville and Bloomfield.

Earlier this month, City Council struck down legislation that would allow neighborhoods to decide whether they wanted inclusionary zoning added to new developments.

“We need zoning changes to make it easier to build the housing that we desperately need, especially smaller and more affordable homes,” Dave Breingan, co-chair of Pittsburgh United’s Housing Justice Table, said. “That includes adopting inclusionary zoning citywide to make sure that we’re creating housing for neighbors of all income levels.”

Mr. Gainey said the introduction of citywide inclusionary zoning could ultimately help attract more people to Pittsburgh.

“The more housing we have, the more the people can live in the community and be connected to their safety nets,” he said. “The more housing we have for our people, the more people move into the city. That’s how we repopulate our city … change doesn’t come easy, but it comes in time.”

Mr. Mosley credited the evictions at Penn Plaza as a “wake-up call” about the scarcity of affordable housing and pledged to work towards passing inclusionary zoning.

“That will grow the city and grow our economy, but most importantly, it lifts up the most vulnerable among us,” he said.

Mr. Taylor said Monday’s rally kicks off a year of events related to promoting housing solutions.

"Housing advocates rally to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of mass evictions at Penn Plaza.

Housing Advocates Rally, Decrying ""Decade of Displacement"" Ten Years After Penn Plaza Evictions

PITTSBURGH, PA – July 29, 2025 – A somber yet defiant crowd of housing advocates, former residents, and community organizers gathered today outside the gleaming towers that now stand where the Penn Plaza apartments once loomed in East Liberty. The rally marked the grim 10-year anniversary of the mass evictions that displaced hundreds of low-income residents, a pivotal moment in Pittsburgh's ongoing struggle with gentrification and affordable housing.

Under a sky that mirrored the mixed emotions of the day – partly cloudy with intermittent bursts of sunlight – speakers took to a makeshift podium, their voices amplified by a portable sound system, to recount the pain and resilience born from the Penn Plaza exodus. Banners bearing slogans like ""Never Forget Penn Plaza"" and ""Housing is a Human Right"" fluttered in the breeze, while attendees held photographs of the demolished apartment buildings and the faces of those displaced.

""Ten years ago, we witnessed a profound injustice unfold right here,"" declared Sarah Jenkins, executive director of the Pittsburgh Tenants Union, her voice cracking with emotion. ""Families, many of whom had lived in Penn Plaza for decades, were unceremoniously uprooted to make way for luxury development. This wasn't just about buildings; it was about lives, communities, and the very fabric of East Liberty being torn apart.""

The Penn Plaza evictions, which began in earnest in 2015, saw hundreds of residents, primarily Black and elderly individuals, forced to vacate their affordable units to make way for what is now a sprawling mix of upscale apartments, retail, and office spaces. The event became a flashpoint, galvanizing housing justice movements across the city and beyond.

Former Penn Plaza resident, eighty-two-year-old Mary Johnson, shared her personal story, her voice wavering but resolute. ""They told us we had to leave, just like that. No real help, no concern for where we would go,"" she recalled, tears welling in her eyes. ""My neighbors, my friends – we were scattered to the winds. It's been a long ten years trying to find a place that feels like home again."" Johnson now lives in subsidized housing several miles from her former neighborhood.

Organizers highlighted that the Penn Plaza evictions were not an isolated incident but rather a stark illustration of a broader trend of displacement driven by rapid development and a shrinking supply of truly affordable housing in Pittsburgh. They pointed to rising rents, stagnant wages, and the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities as evidence that the lessons of Penn Plaza have yet to be fully learned.

""We stand here today not just to remember, but to demand action,"" asserted community activist David Lee. ""The legacy of Penn Plaza is a reminder that without strong tenant protections, inclusive zoning, and significant investment in public and affordable housing, more communities will face the same fate. We need policies that prioritize people over profit.""

The rally concluded with a symbolic moment of silence, followed by attendees sharing personal reflections and commitments to continue the fight for housing justice. As the crowd dispersed, the towering presence of the new Penn Plaza development loomed in the background, a silent, stark contrast to the memories and renewed resolve of those who gathered to ensure its history is never forgotten. The struggle for equitable housing in Pittsburgh, it was clear, is far from over.","Housing advocates rally to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of mass evictions at Penn Plaza.You are a professional journalist You are supposed to generate the content that fits this title, make it sound realistic.",fake,1
"Volunteer firefighter in Connecticut killed by falling fire truck fragment.

A tragic accident has claimed the life of a volunteer firefighter in Connecticut after a large mechanical component detached from a fire truck and struck him during a training drill on Sunday afternoon, officials said.

According to the Connecticut State Fire Marshal’s Office, 34-year-old Thomas “Tommy” Alvarez, a longtime member of the North Haven Volunteer Fire Department, was killed when a section of a fire truck’s aerial ladder assembly broke loose unexpectedly and fell during a routine apparatus check.

The incident occurred around 2:45 p.m. at the North Haven Fire Training Grounds on Maple Avenue, where several volunteer crews were participating in a weekend skills refresher. Witnesses say the firefighters had just completed an inspection of Engine 5, a 2006 ladder truck, when a heavy steel stabilizer arm swung loose and dropped without warning.

Alvarez, who was standing beside the truck reviewing a checklist, was struck directly in the upper torso and head. He was pronounced dead at the scene despite immediate CPR and emergency efforts by fellow firefighters and EMTs.

“This is an unimaginable loss,” said North Haven Fire Chief Karen Deluca at a somber press conference Monday morning. “Tommy was a devoted volunteer, a mentor to our younger members, and a friend to all. We are heartbroken.”

Alvarez had volunteered with the department for over 12 years and was known for his community service and mechanical expertise. He also worked full-time as a mechanic at a local auto repair shop.

The fire truck involved has been taken out of service and is undergoing a forensic inspection by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the manufacturer, Spartan Emergency Response. Preliminary reports suggest a possible failure in a hydraulic lock mechanism, though officials caution that the investigation is ongoing.

Governor Ned Lamont issued a statement offering condolences to Alvarez’s family and directing flags to be flown at half-staff in his honor. “Connecticut mourns the loss of a selfless individual who gave his time and heart to protecting others,” the governor wrote.

A memorial service for Alvarez is being planned later this week. He is survived by his wife, Maria, and their two young daughters.

Counseling services are being made available to all department members. Chief Deluca urged residents to “keep Tommy’s family and our fire family in your prayers.”",generate a news article with this title: Volunteer firefighter in Connecticut killed by falling fire truck fragment,fake,1
"Volunteer firefighter in Connecticut killed by falling fire truck fragment.

A 35-year veteran of the Plainville Fire Department in Connecticut was killed at the scene of a house fire Sunday morning, police said. Raymond Moreau, 60, was dispatched with the Plainville Fire Department to respond to a house fire at 45 Maria Road at 6:20 a.m. Sunday, Connecticut State Police said in a press release. Moreau was standing near a fire truck outside of the house when a fragment of the truck “broke free and struck firefighter Moreau, causing catastrophic injuries to his leg,” Connecticut State Police Captain Kate Coney said at a press conference. Moreau was rushed to a nearby hospital, she said, and succumbed to his injuries during surgery. 

There were no other injuries at the house fire, the fire department said in a Facebook post.  

Moreau began volunteering with the department in July 1990, and devoted “tens of thousands of hours” to the community, Coney said. 

Moreau was a veteran of the U.S. Marines Corps, and was described as a loving father and dedicated public servant. 

“The loss of Ray Monroe cuts like a knife at the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection,” Ronnel Higgins, the department’s commissioner, said during the press conference. “This isn’t merely a job or a hobby, being a volunteer firefighter, it is a calling. And Ray answered the call.”

Michael Paulhus, Plainville’s town manager, emphasized the “tremendous loss” to the town.

“35 years is a lot to give to a community,” Paulhus said. “And he did it with dignity and honor.”

A ceremony is planned for Tuesday evening to honor Moreau, the town said in a Facebook post.

Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut announced Sunday that he is directing U.S. and state flags in the state to be lowered to half-staff in honor of Moreau. 

“Today’s tragedy is another reminder about the extraordinary risk that firefighters face as part of their duties, and they are heroes for assuming these responsibilities,” Lamont said in a statement.

"WATER CRISIS GRIPS DWARKA AS SUMMER PEAKS.

As the sun beats down harder each day, residents of Dwarka, once hailed as a model sub-city of Delhi, find themselves facing a familiar and distressing challenge- water scarcity. What was thought to be a resolved issue has now come back to haunt thousands of families across sectors in summers. Just a few years ago, it was the tireless efforts of the Federation of Cooperative Group Housing Societies (CGHS) Dwarka under the leadership of Sudha Sinha, Mg Editor Dwarka City, that brought respite to the water-starved sub-city. At the time, water supply was not only irregular but also contaminated, leaving residents frustrated and helpless. The Federation had then taken the issue head- on filing petitions, conducting dharnas, holding negotiations with top officials of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) and demanding that the responsibility of water distribution be formally handed over from DDA to DJB. And it worked. A modern water treatment plant was commissioned, pipelines were laid, and water began flowing into homes with reliability and improved quality.
But as with many civic victories in our cities, the success proved to be temporary. Today, with Dwarka's population rising sharply and temperatures soaring, the water crisis has returned and this time, with a vengeance. Residents of sectors like 22, 23, 19, 12, 11, 10, 6, 5 and 4 and even parts of Sector-7 and Sector-3 are grappling with low pressure, erratic timings and in many cases, a complete halt in supply.
Life Reduced to Buckets and Barrels-
In Sector-6, residents wake up at dawn not to the comfort of a routine, but to a race for water. “Until
last year, we received water twice a day and even that was manageable,” says Kavita Malhotra, a homemaker from DDA flats. “Now it comes at 4 a.m., that too for barely 20 minutes. It’s like a cruel lottery - sometimes we get water, sometimes nothing at all.” In nearby Sector-4, the problem is worse. Rohit Srivastava, explains how families have started storing water in bulk using large drums, buckets, and even repurposed paint containers. “We’ve gone back in time - this feels like the early 2000s when water was a daily crisis. And what’s more painful is, after all the infrastructure upgrades, we’re back to square one,” he said. Tankers: Lifeline or Loot?- While the Delhi Jal Board has dispatched water tankers to ease the situation, many residents allege that the service is being misused and monetized. Tankers that are supposed to supply water free of cost under DJB’s emergency service often demand hefty payments. “We were asked to pay ₹1,200 for a single tanker trip. This is not just wrong - it’s exploitation,” said a school teacher and resident of Sector- 19's Suryodaya Apartments. “When you don’t have water to bathe your children or cook meals, what choice do you have but to pay?” In some areas, residents claim they’ve been blacklisted from tanker routes for refusing to pay bribes. “One official tanker driver told us, ‘If you want regular water, you’ll have to keep the drivers happy’,” said an elderly resident of Sector-3 who wished to remain anonymous.
Rising Demand, Stagnant Supply- The core issue appears to be the mismatch between Dwarka’s rising population and its static infrastructure. New high-rises and expanding residential colonies have come up in every sector, while the water supply hasn’t been augmented to meet the increased demand. “Dwarka has changed - it’s now a densely populated urban zone, not a quiet sub-city. Yet, water management hasn’t kept pace,” says Anil Chopra, of Sector-22. “We need a completely new plan - including recycling, increased borewells, and upgraded pipelines.” RWAs Speaks Out Again In response to the growing crisis, many RWAs and MCs and social organisation has once again mobilized. Letters have been sent to DJB stating, “Water is not a luxury. It's a right.” To address the ongoing water crisis effectively, several immediate measures have been proposed. First and foremost is the urgent augmentation of existing water supply lines to ensure adequate distribution across all sectors. Alongside this, the deployment of free water tankers under the strict supervision of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has been recommended, with clear accountability mechanisms to prevent misuse and ensure timely delivery. Equally important is the upgradation of old and inefficient pipelines, particularly in low-pressure zones, to improve water flow and reduce wastage. Additionally, it has been suggested that sector-wise water supply schedules be publicly displayed to keep residents informed and allow them to plan their usage accordingly. These steps aim to provide immediate relief while laying the foundation for a more sustainable water management system in Dwarka. In the meantime, residents continue to suffer in silence. “Children are skipping baths, elders are falling sick and domestic routines are in chaos,” laments Renu Pathak, a working mother in Sector-12.
“What kind of capital city is this where we still need to beg for water?” The water crisis in Dwarka is more than a civic failure - it's a question of human dignity. For a sub-city once envisioned as a beacon of planned development, it is both ironic and tragic that basic needs like water remain unmet. As the mercury rises and tempers fray, one can only hope that authorities will finally hear the cries of a community running dry. In the meantime, residents are learning to live with storage buckets, tanker schedules, and growing uncertainty.
Will Dwarka ever be truly quenched? Or will its residents remain trapped in a cycle of promises and parched pipelines? Dwarka residents share their views-
The cooperative group housing societies in Dwarka are grappling with a severe drinking water crisis, largely attributed to the Delhi Jal Board's (DJB) policies and inefficient water management. Despite being one of the most prominent residential hubs in Delhi, Dwarka faces significant challenges in accessing clean drinking water.
Causes of the Water Crisis- Inadequate Water Supply -: The DJB's inability to ensure a consistent water supply has resulted in frequent disruptions, affecting residents' daily lives. A recent breach at the carrier-lined canal branch has left some areas without water supply for several days.
Pollution of Water Sources: High ammonia levels in the Yamuna River have impacted water treatment plants, reducing their capacity to produce clean drinking water. This issue is further exacerbated by the discharge of toxic waste from small and medium industries into the river. Inefficient Water Management: The DJB's inefficient water management has led to water rationing strategies, affecting many areas in Delhi including Dwarka. Inter-State Water Disputes: Delhi's reliance on neighboring states for water supply has led to disputes over water allocation, further complicating the crisis. Impact on Residents: Health Issues: The reduced availability of clean water has increased the risk of waterborne diseases, particularly in marginalized communities. Economic Strain: The dependence on water tankers for domestic needs can be unreliable and costly, leading to further economic strain for residents. Productivity Loss: Frequent illnesses due to poor hygiene and sanitation have impacted productivity, affecting residents' economic well-being and academic opportunities. Solutions to Address the Water Crisis: Water Conservation and Management: Implementing measures to conserve water, such as fixing leaks and promoting water-efficient appliances, can help alleviate the crisis. Technological Interventions: The DJB's use of field sensors and smart meters can enable remote and real-time monitoring of water distribution networks, improving efficiency.
Infrastructure Development: Increasing investment in water infrastructure and improving the DJB's operational efficiency can help enhance water supply. Community Participation: Organizing awareness campaigns and promoting rainwater harvesting can help
reduce the demand on existing water sources.

Water is not just a resource; it’s the essence of life. Water is the basic necessity of every human being. However, despite abundance on the globe, the issue of water scarcity is rising rapidly. We often talk/read about ‘water stress’ in a global parlance, which means occurrence of scarcity when demand for safe, usable water in a given area exceeds the supply. On a country level, the problem has become so severe that in many states the groundwater has almost dried up and people have to depend on water supply from other sources. On a local level for a city, the scarcity or stress if we want to call it holds true in the current scenario as well. Growing population, urbanization and lack of proper water management systems. In addition, wastage of water remains the most ignored form of resource mismanagement. Despite growing awareness around environmental issues, water - a vital and finite natural resource - is often taken for granted. From dripping taps and overuse in households to inefficient practices, water wastage continues unchecked. Earlier, people understood the value of water and planned their lives around it. But today, in spite of having knowledge, we still fail to understand the value of water in our lives. It is the central point of our lives but unfortunately, not our priority concern. Imagine waking up one day, getting ready for work, only to find out that there’s no water in your tap? This can be a reality soon if we do not pay attention on the resource management and consumption patterns. The saying goes - “When the well’s dry, we know the worth of water.” Just for reference or context, a report from a reputed research highlights that there were 44 lakes and 355 ponds about 10-15 years back and only half of these remain as the other half have either dried up or were lost to urbanization, pollution and over-consumption. Back in 2012, Delhi Jal Board conducted a survey, according to which the water treatment and supply capacity of Delhi was 3,231.9 Million Litres per Day (MLD). However, the water demand of the city, at 3,859 MLD, was much higher - this means that a large number of people in Delhi faced acute water shortage during the year! Though things seem to have improved over the last few years in terms of mobilizing the supply of water from other sources (like Haryana), but the core issue of streamlined availability and water wastage still persist. In Dwarka, the residents have been trying to manage their water demand by procuring water from government tankers or purchasing water from private tankers. The water supplied by tankers is uncertain and the availability of such tankers also seems to be diminishing by the day. Needless to say, that such shortage also leads to escalated costs of procurement of water which will eventually have to be born by the residents. From a resident’s perspective, it’s either no water or water at a higher cost, where a resident has no other option than to bear the additional cost. One must also note that investment in water infrastructure is costly; requires substantial human, energy and material resources; is limited by natural conditions such as geographic location and topography. While the authorities are focussing on sourcing, transportation and investments in various projects, the residents can contribute to significant reduction of this scarcity by being aware, responsible and through some innovation. The foremost and immediate step the residents in houses / complex (society) can do is to check on dripping taps and replace them, avoid running taps which is a usual habit while washing dishes/clothes or hands. Though these actions seem minute, but research suggests that these actions save thousands of litres of water wastage. One of the most silent yet significant contributors to urban water wastage is leakage in pipelines — often hidden underground or within walls, going unnoticed for long periods. A regular audit and maintenance program is essential to identify and fix these leaks, thereby conserving considerable amount of water annually. Steps for such prompt action include - prompt repair, efficient reporting system and use of durable materials like replacing old, corroded pipes with long-lasting, non-corrosive alternatives. Installation of water tank alarms to avoid overflowing of water, which would otherwise have been wasted, would also lead to reduction in electricity consumption, minimize water damage to walls and roofs. These devices alert users when the water tank is about to overflow, helping to avoid unnecessary spillage and conserve this precious resource. Shift green spaces of gardens to sprinkler systems instead of conventional water supply through a hose pipe manually. Schedule watering during early morning or late evening to reduce evaporation. We can also explore the options of treating locally the water from sinks, showers and laundry and reusing them for gardening / flushing. Implementing a rainwater harvesting system is a forward-thinking and sustainable solution to address water scarcity, reduce dependency on municipal supply, and promote responsible water management. It involves collecting, storing and using rainwater that falls on rooftops and open spaces. Instead of letting it flow into drains, this water is diverted through pipes and filtered into storage tanks or recharge pits. There might be apprehensions on the initial capital costs but it can reduce water bills substantially in the long run. From a policy and regulation point of view, complexes can look at conducting annual water audits, imposing penalties for water wastage or conversely offer incentives or rebates for adopting water efficient fixtures or practices. On a broader horizon, we can support groundwater recharge by adopting mindful construction practices or modifying the existing concrete/marble structure during repair. Examples of these mechanisms include replacing concrete and tiles in open areas with permeable or porous materials which allow rainwater to seep into the ground rather than running off into drains, incorporating recharge wells in parking lots or garden areas, avoid excess paving around trees and green zones to aid water absorption. While policies, infrastructure upgrades and technology play a vital role in managing water sustainably, their success ultimately depends on people. Without active public awareness and participation, even the best systems can fail. Although water supply may be significantly affected in the future by climate change as a result of varying precipitation and increasing temperature, water demand may increase over time due to rapid urbanization. It is therefore evident that water conservation is not the job of the government alone.

Dwarka City Newspaper deserves sincere appreciation for consistently publishing news and views on pressing civic issues, particularly the growing water crisis being faced by residents across various societies in Dwarka, including Prabha Apartments. Such journalistic efforts are instrumental in raising awareness and encouraging proactive community engagement. Needonomics School of Thought (NST) views water not merely as a resource, but as a shared responsibility. In the context of Prabha Apartments, it is encouraging to note that the active leadership of Ms. Madhu Kumar has been actively involved in monitoring the water situation and implementing preventive measures. This includes leak detection, regulating supply timings and educating residents on water-saving practices. NST advocates for ""Needo-consumption""-a mindful and ethical approach to using resources, especially something as vital as water. This pragmatism urges residents to move away from wasteful habits driven by convenience or ignorance, and instead embrace consumption patterns aligned with genuine needs. It reminds us that every drop saved is a step toward sustainability and communal well-being. The water crisis is not just a government or society-level issue; it is a call for responsible behavior from each individual. By fostering a culture of cooperation and collective responsibility, communities like Prabha Apartments can set an example in sustainable living. Let us recognize the role of conscious citizenship, informed media, and need-based economics in addressing the water challenge before it becomes irreversible. Together, through Needo-Consumption of water, we can ensure water security for today and tomorrow.

Water scarcity in Dwarka is no longer a distant threat-it is a pressing daily reality for many of our residential societies. With each passing summer, the problem deepens, leaving residents anxious and frustrated. The supply from Delhi Jal Board (DJB) through main lines is increasingly inadequate. Tankers, the supposed backup lifeline, are scarce and often delayed. In desperation, societies turn to private suppliers-only to face another blockade: official restrictions on their operations. This puts residents in a double bind-insufficient public supply and restricted private options. Water that is allocated for Dwarka is allegedly being diverted to other zones, including the airport and nearby unauthorized colonies. Unregulated theft through illegal connections only worsens the shortfall. As a glaring example, a structure in Sector-12, despite being declared unauthorized and marked for demolition, continues to tap into DJB water without consequence. These compounding issues demand immediate attention: • Equitable Distribution: There needs to be transparency and fairness in water allocation, ensuring residential needs are prioritized over non-essential diversions. • Enhanced Monitoring: Crackdowns on illegal connections and stricter enforcement against water theft must be implemented. • Infrastructure Upgrades: Modernizing the water supply system to meet the growing demands of Dwarka’s population is crucial. • Policy Reforms: A clearer policy that allows regulated private tanker services during shortages would bring relief and reduce black-market dependency. • Community Engagement: Resident welfare associations must be included in planning, monitoring, and grievance redressal processes. This is a call to action—not just for the authorities, but for residents, civil society, and local leaders. Access to safe, sufficient water is not a privilege; it is a fundamental right. Dwarka’s communities deserve better.

"WATER CRISIS GRIPS DWARKA AS SUMMER PEAKS.

New Delhi, July 30, 2025 — As temperatures continue to soar across the capital, the sprawling sub-city of Dwarka finds itself at the center of an escalating water crisis. Residents from multiple sectors have reported irregular supply, low pressure, and in some areas, complete dry taps for days on end — painting a grim picture of the summer season’s strain on basic infrastructure.

Residents Struggle Amid Dwindling Supplies
Sectors 7, 11, 13, and 23 have been particularly affected. In several housing societies, residents have resorted to purchasing water from private tankers, often at inflated prices. “We are paying ₹2,000 for a tanker that barely lasts two days for our society,” said Meera Kapoor, RWA President of a residential complex in Sector 11. “There’s no clear communication from the authorities — only chaos and confusion.”
With the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) pipelines running dry, borewells have become the fallback option. However, groundwater levels have dropped significantly, further compounding the problem.

Heatwave Intensifies the Crisis
The relentless heatwave — with mercury breaching 45°C — has only worsened the situation. Increased demand for water for drinking, cooling, and hygiene has severely outpaced supply. Hospitals and schools in the region have also sounded the alarm. “We are limiting our water use to essential procedures only,” said Dr. Anil Menon, administrator at a private clinic in Sector 6. “This is bordering on a public health emergency.”
Authorities Cite Multiple Causes
Officials from the DJB have cited pipeline damage, unauthorized tapping, and low production from treatment plants due to Yamuna’s reduced water levels as contributing factors. The Yamuna’s flow, dependent on upstream releases from Haryana, has been at its lowest this season.
In response, the DJB claims to have deployed emergency tankers and promised pipeline repair work “on a war footing.” However, local residents argue that the measures are far too slow and scattered to meet daily needs.

Calls for Structural Reforms and Transparency
Urban planners and environmentalists argue that the crisis is symptomatic of a deeper issue — overdevelopment without sustainable water management. “Dwarka was not planned for the population it currently holds. Rainwater harvesting is underutilized, and groundwater is being overexploited,” said Anupama Ghosh, a water resource expert.
RWAs and citizen groups are demanding both immediate relief and long-term commitments: better tanker distribution, functional borewells, audit of illegal water connections, and fast-tracking of rainwater harvesting initiatives.

What Lies Ahead
For now, residents are bracing for a long, dry August. With monsoon delays and no clear resolution in sight, many are taking matters into their own hands — rationing water, sharing resources with neighbors, and amplifying their concerns on social media in hopes of pressuring the administration into faster action.
As Dwarka’s parched households wait anxiously for the next drop, the summer of 2025 is fast turning into a season of crisis — and a stark reminder of the capital’s fragile water security.","generate an article on the title: ""WATER CRISIS GRIPS DWARKA AS SUMMER PEAKS""",fake,1
"Former Shelton High teacher, coach charged with sexually assaulting student, police say.

SHELTON — A former Shelton High School teacher and coach was arrested Friday after he was accused of sexually assaulting a student, according to police.  

Jason Kymer, 38, is charged with second-degree sexual assault, risk of injury to a child and tampering with a witness, Shelton police Capt. Robert Kozlowsky said in a news release.

Officers began investigating Kymer, of Beacon Falls, in June 2025 after they learned he previously had been involved in a sexual relationship with a female who was a high school student at the time, Kozlowsky said. Shelton detectives found the victim, who said the sexual relationship began when she was 17 years old and that the sexual contact occurred in the school, according to Kozlowsky. 

The victim, who had blocked Kymer’s number, received a phone call from an unknown number during the investigation, Kozlowsky said. When she answered the call, she recognized Kymer’s voice and she said he told her, “Just do the right thing,” according to Kozlowsky. 

Kymer was a physical education teacher and girls track coach at the high school. He said in June that he was on administrative leave with pay, and police referred to him Friday as a “Former High School Teacher.” 

He was released on a $50,000 bond and was scheduled to appear at state Superior Court in Derby Aug. 25, according to Kozlowsky. ",https://www.sheltonherald.com/news/article/former-shelton-high-school-sex-assault-kymer-20875901.php,real,0

"Man stole a car to ""travel around Shandong""? Police: Wake up, your final destination has arrived!.

Recently, police in Shandong successfully cracked a bizarre theft case. A man stole a sedan and embarked on a so-called “road trip” across multiple cities in Shandong Province, claiming it was his dream journey. However, the surreal trip didn’t last long—he was ultimately intercepted by police in Weifang, abruptly ending his ride.

According to police reports, the suspect, surnamed Li, 30 years old and unemployed, had been drifting from place to place. A few days ago, he spotted an unlocked car in a parking lot in Jinan and, taking advantage of the owner’s carelessness, drove off. He then traveled through cities such as Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai, and Linyi, posting photos on social media along the way with captions like: “Life is about spontaneous travel.”

Police tracked the car via surveillance footage and arrested him at a gas station in Weifang. When questioned, Li said, “I was just borrowing the car for a quick road trip. I never intended to sell it or hurt anyone.”

Li has been placed in criminal detention, and the case is under further investigation. Authorities also reminded car owners to lock their vehicles and keep their keys safe.

As the police noted: “Life can be spontaneous—but don’t step on the gas pedal of the law!”","please use this topic: 男子偷车“环游山东”？警方：醒醒，你的终点站到了！

"Man stole a car to ""travel around Shandong""? Police: Wake up, your final destination has arrived!.

I once dreamed of traveling the world with a sword and seeing the prosperity of the world... Riding on my beloved car and going on a trip at any time is the dream of many people.

However, this man built his ""yearning"" on stealing other people's property and started a ""cross-city journey"" on a stolen bicycle. In the end, what awaited him could only be legal sanctions.

Recently, the Nanma Police Station of the Yiyuan County Public Security Bureau received a report from the masses that their mountain bikes parked in the carport of the community were stolen. After receiving the report, the police immediately rushed to the scene to investigate. By retrieving the surveillance video of the crime scene and the surrounding area, the police found that on the day of the crime, a suspicious man walked into the community where the victim lived. The man wandered around the community and finally locked his target on an unlocked mountain bike in the carport. Seeing that there was no one around, the man quickly rode away.

After locking the suspect, the police followed the line and found that he had fled to the neighboring Yishui County on a bicycle. The man deliberately evaded investigation during his escape, making it difficult to track him, but the police officers in charge of the case were not discouraged and continued to conduct in-depth research and analysis, and finally captured the key clue: the man appeared near a university in Zhangdian District, Zibo City. The police rushed to Zhangdian and successfully arrested the suspect after careful deployment and detailed investigation.

After interrogation, the suspect confessed that he had no fixed job and was idle on weekdays. Before the incident, he fled to Yiyuan County. Because he was short of money, he had the idea of stealing bicycles and selling them for money. After he succeeded, he did not sell the stolen goods immediately, but rode the stolen bike whimsically, and fled to Linyi, Rizhao, Qingdao, Weifang and other places, and finally returned to Zibo. In Zibo, he sold the victim's mountain bike. After that, he stole another mountain bike near the university again, trying to continue his ""journey"". However, the law is long, and he was arrested by the Yiyuan police who arrived in time before he could ""set off"" again.

At present, the case is under further investigation.",https://news.lznews.cn/luzhong/quxian/202507/t20250722_16244391.html,real,0
"Suspect taken into custody after hiding in rafters at Mall 205 Target during standoff with police.

A man was taken into custody Monday afternoon after a bizarre six-hour standoff with police at the Target store in Mall 205, during which he reportedly climbed into the building’s rafters in an attempt to evade arrest.

According to the Portland Police Bureau, officers were called to the scene at approximately 9:45 a.m. after store employees reported a man acting erratically in the electronics section. Witnesses said the individual had been shouting at staff and customers and appeared to be under the influence of a substance.

When security approached the man, he allegedly brandished what appeared to be a makeshift weapon—a broken tripod stand—before fleeing deeper into the store. Surveillance footage later revealed that he had accessed a back storeroom and climbed into the ceiling rafters through an unsecured maintenance ladder.

Store management quickly evacuated shoppers and staff as officers arrived and began attempting to negotiate with the man, who remained hidden among the ductwork and support beams. Authorities used thermal imaging drones and a long-range acoustic device (LRAD) to maintain communication and monitor movement.

“This was not a standard arrest situation,” said Lieutenant Erica Dawson of the PPB. “Our team had to balance the structural risks of the ceiling space with the need to bring the suspect down safely.”

After several hours of negotiation—and following a brief moment where the man threatened to jump—officers deployed a non-lethal irritant to encourage him to surrender. He was eventually coaxed down around 3:50 p.m. and taken into custody without injury.

The suspect, a 34-year-old man with no known address, is currently being evaluated for mental health concerns. Police said he may face charges including criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest.

No injuries to staff or customers were reported, though the incident caused significant disruption to store operations. The Target location remained closed for the rest of the day for inspection and cleanup.

“While this was an unusual event, we’re grateful for the quick and professional response from local law enforcement,” said a Target spokesperson. “We’ll continue cooperating fully with the investigation.”

Authorities have not confirmed whether the suspect had any prior history at the location.","Suspect taken into custody after hiding in rafters at Mall 205 Target during standoff with police

"Suspect taken into custody after hiding in rafters at Mall 205 Target during standoff with police.

PORTLAND, Ore. — A suspect has been taken into custody following a lengthy standoff at the Target store in Mall 205 in East Portland. Police could be seen escorting the person out of the Target just after 4 p.m., more than six hours after police were first called to the store.

In a news release after the standoff ended, the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) East Precinct officers responded to a call about a disturbance with a weapon at 10:29 a.m. Monday. The person was reported to be armed with a knife and a hatchet, and ran into the store after being confronted by a security officer.

The security officer was treated by medical personnel at the scene but did not require hospitalization, PPB said.

Police evacuated the store and officers began searching the premises, eventually locating the suspect on the second story of some shelving in an inventory storage area at the back of the store. PPB Public Information Officer Terri Wallo Strauss told KGW at around noon that the person was in the rafters of the building.

PPB's Enhanced Crisis Intervention Team responded and talked to the person for a while, then Crisis Negotiation Team members took over the negotiation.

The Mall 205 parking lot area around the store's front entrance was roped off with police tape as of around noon Monday, and officers could be seen standing at the doors. More than a dozen Target employees could be seen standing off to the side in the parking lot.

The suspect dropped the knife at 4:01 p.m. and was taken into custody, PPB said, but said further details about the person's identity and potential criminal charges will come later.

"Suspected to Have Been Swept Away by a Rip Current… Missing Teen Found Lifeless After Swimming at Longfeng Fishing Harbor in Zhunan, Miaoli.

Six boys who just graduated from junior high school went swimming yesterday at Longfeng Fishing Harbor in Zhunan Township, Miaoli County. Among them, a 15-year-old boy surnamed Wu was suspected to have been swept away by a rip current. After extensive search efforts by land, sea, and air, he was found this afternoon around 3 p.m. in the sea 2 to 3 kilometers north of where he went missing. Unfortunately, he was already lifeless when recovered.

The Coast Guard Administration's Central Region's Third Coastal Patrol Team received a report around 6:30 p.m. yesterday. Wu, along with three male and two female classmates, had gone to Fengji Beach north of Longfeng Fishing Harbor. Wu and two other male classmates entered the water when they were suddenly pulled away, and Wu went missing. Coast Guard personnel, drones, a 100-ton patrol boat from Taichung’s Coast Guard, and members of the Miaoli Water Rescue Association were all mobilized for a land-sea-air search operation, which continued through the night without success. The search resumed early this morning, with a helicopter from the National Airborne Service Corps joining the effort.

Around 2:45 p.m. this afternoon, the helicopter spotted Wu’s body floating in the sea approximately 2 to 3 kilometers north of Longfeng Fishing Harbor and about 400 meters offshore. However, due to poor sea conditions, rescuers had difficulty approaching. The body was eventually retrieved and hoisted to shore by helicopter. Wu’s family, who thought he had gone out for a part-time job, was devastated upon learning of the tragedy.

Local residents suspect Wu drowned after being swept away by a rip current. Although the sea off Fengji Beach appears calm, it hides a narrow, fast-moving current that flows from the beach toward the open sea. Its powerful force makes it hard for swimmers to escape. Similar incidents have occurred in this area before, so extreme caution is advised when swimming here.",https://udn.com/news/story/7320/8900305,real,0
"Suspected to Have Been Swept Away by a Rip Current… Missing Teen Found Lifeless After Swimming at Longfeng Fishing Harbor in Zhunan, Miaoli.

Zhunan, Miaoli – A community is in mourning after a search and rescue operation concluded tragically this evening with the discovery of a missing teenager, identified as 16-year-old Lin Wei-Cheng, found lifeless near Longfeng Fishing Harbor. Lin had been reported missing since yesterday afternoon after going for a swim with friends. Authorities suspect a powerful rip current may have pulled him out to sea.

The incident unfolded on Sunday, July 27, 2025, around 3:30 PM. Lin Wei-Cheng, a student at Zhunan Senior High School, had gone to Longfeng Fishing Harbor with three classmates to cool off from the sweltering summer heat. According to his friends, they were swimming in an area slightly north of the main harbor entrance, an unofficial swimming spot popular with locals despite advisories against swimming due to strong currents.

""We were just having fun, splashing around,"" recounted a visibly shaken Chen Yi-Fan, one of Lin's friends, to local reporters. ""Suddenly, Wei-Cheng started yelling. He was much further out than us, and he looked like he was struggling. We tried to swim towards him, but the current was too strong. He just… disappeared.""

The friends immediately alerted bystanders, who then contacted the Miaoli County Fire Department. A large-scale search operation was launched involving multiple units, including the Coast Guard Administration, local police, and volunteer rescue teams. Drones were deployed, and rescue boats scoured the coastline throughout Sunday evening and Monday morning.

The grim discovery was made around 6:15 PM today, Monday, July 28, 2025, by a Coast Guard patrol boat approximately 1.5 kilometers offshore from the fishing harbor. Lin Wei-Cheng's body was recovered and brought back to the harbor, where his distraught parents were waiting.

""My son… he was such a good boy,"" sobbed Mrs. Lin, clutching a photograph of her son. ""He loved the ocean, but he was always so careful. I warned him about swimming there, but he said everyone goes. Why? Why did this happen?""

Captain Wang Kuo-Hao of the Miaoli County Fire Department addressed the media, stating, ""While a full investigation is underway, the preliminary assessment points towards a rip current as the likely cause. The waters around Longfeng Fishing Harbor, particularly outside the protected harbor basin, are known for unpredictable and strong currents, especially during certain tidal conditions. We repeatedly issue warnings about the dangers of swimming in unpatrolled and unapproved areas.""

Local residents have long expressed concerns about the informal swimming areas around the harbor. Mr. Chang Li-Wei, a fisherman who has worked at Longfeng for over 30 years, commented, ""Every summer, we see people swimming there, often teenagers. It's dangerous. The currents can change so quickly. There should be more prominent warning signs, or even patrols to keep people out of the risky spots.""

The Zhunan Township Office has issued a statement expressing their condolences to the Lin family and reiterating the importance of adhering to swimming safety regulations. They are expected to meet with maritime authorities to discuss further measures to enhance safety around coastal areas in the region.

The tragic death of Lin Wei-Cheng serves as a stark reminder of the hidden dangers of the ocean, even in seemingly calm waters. Authorities urge the public to only swim at designated beaches with lifeguard supervision and to always be aware of local water conditions and warnings.","Generate a fake news article in English.

"R. A. Puram gets a new-look park and open-air gym facility. Community ‘greens’ the park zone.

R. A. Puram residents are celebrating a significant milestone in their neighborhood's development with the inauguration of a completely transformed park space that now features modern amenities and an open-air gymnasium. The revitalized green space represents months of collaborative effort between local authorities and community members who united to create a healthier, more vibrant recreational area for all age groups.

## A Vision Realized

The transformation of the R. A. Puram park began as a grassroots initiative when residents expressed concerns about the deteriorating condition of the existing recreational space. What was once an underutilized area with basic facilities has now emerged as a comprehensive wellness destination that caters to the diverse needs of the community.

The new-look park spans several acres and incorporates sustainable design principles throughout its layout. Walking paths wind through carefully landscaped gardens, while dedicated zones accommodate different activities ranging from children's play areas to senior citizen exercise spaces. The integration of native plants and trees not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also contributes to the local ecosystem's health.

## Modern Fitness Meets Nature

The centerpiece of the renovation is the state-of-the-art open-air gymnasium that offers residents access to professional-grade fitness equipment without the constraints of indoor facilities. The outdoor gym features weather-resistant apparatus including pull-up stations, parallel bars, elliptical trainers, and multi-station workout units designed to provide comprehensive fitness opportunities.

""We wanted to create a space where fitness enthusiasts could exercise while enjoying fresh air and natural surroundings,"" explained a local community leader involved in the project. The gym area is strategically positioned to take advantage of natural shade from mature trees while maintaining clear sightlines for safety and supervision.

## Community-Led Green Initiative

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this transformation is the community-driven approach to environmental enhancement. Local residents organized themselves into volunteer groups, each taking responsibility for different aspects of the park's ecological improvement. These efforts included extensive tree planting drives, installation of rainwater harvesting systems, and the creation of organic composting units to manage park waste sustainably.

The community's commitment to environmental stewardship is evident in the selection of drought-resistant native plants that require minimal water maintenance while providing year-round greenery. Solar-powered lighting systems illuminate pathways during evening hours, reducing the park's carbon footprint while ensuring safe access after sunset.

## Amenities for All Ages

The redesigned park acknowledges the diverse recreational needs of R. A. Puram's multigenerational community. Children can enjoy newly installed playground equipment that meets international safety standards, while teenagers have access to basketball and badminton courts. Senior citizens benefit from dedicated seating areas, gentle exercise equipment, and peaceful meditation spaces.

A central pavilion serves as a gathering point for community events and provides shelter during inclement weather. The facility includes basic amenities such as clean restroom facilities, drinking water stations, and storage areas for maintenance equipment.

## Environmental Impact and Sustainability

The park's transformation extends beyond aesthetics and recreation to address crucial environmental concerns. The increased green cover contributes to air purification and temperature regulation in the neighborhood. Native flowering plants attract local bird species and beneficial insects, enhancing biodiversity within the urban environment.

Rainwater harvesting infrastructure captures monsoon precipitation for irrigation purposes, reducing dependence on municipal water supplies. Permeable paving materials allow natural groundwater recharge while preventing waterlogging during heavy rainfall periods.

## Community Engagement and Maintenance

The success of the R. A. Puram park project demonstrates the power of community collaboration in creating positive neighborhood changes. Residents have established ongoing maintenance committees to ensure the facility remains in excellent condition for future generations. Regular volunteer sessions bring neighbors together for park upkeep activities, fostering social connections alongside environmental stewardship.

Local schools have incorporated the park into their environmental education programs, using the space to teach students about ecology, sustainability, and community responsibility. These educational initiatives ensure that young residents develop an appreciation for green spaces and understand their role in environmental conservation.

## Looking Forward

The transformation of R. A. Puram's park represents more than just infrastructural improvement; it symbolizes a community's commitment to creating healthier, more sustainable living environments. The project serves as a model for other neighborhoods seeking to balance urban development with environmental conservation.

As residents continue to enjoy their enhanced recreational facility, plans are already underway to expand the green initiative to other areas within R. A. Puram. The success of this collaborative effort has inspired additional community-led projects focused on urban gardening, waste reduction, and sustainable transportation options.

The new-look park stands as a testament to what communities can achieve when they unite around shared goals of health, sustainability, and neighborhood improvement. For R. A. Puram residents, this green oasis provides not just a place for exercise and relaxation, but a symbol of their collective commitment to creating a better environment for current and future generations.","R.

"Walking the Rail Trail? You might spot goats doing yard work.

The Chambersburg Town Council has authorized goat grazing along the Conococheague Creek. According to a community announcement, FlockWorks from Orrstown, Pennsylvania, will manage the grazing to clear overgrown land adjacent to the Rail Trail between West King Street and Commerce Street. This initiative, first approved in 2023, aims to remove invasive vegetation in a cost-effective manner.

Starting the week of July 21, FlockWorks will set up fencing and signage in the grazing areas, beginning south of Commerce Street and progressing toward West King Street. The company will oversee the maintenance and monitoring of these areas.

Residents are reminded of the following rules while visiting the grazing site: Keep dogs away from the electric fence to ensure the goats feel safe. Dogs, regardless of size, should not chase the goats or patrol the fence. Feeding the goats is prohibited, as their role is to consume the vegetation in the designated area. Visitors should not introduce any plants, as many common yard plants can be toxic to goats. Additionally, touching the electric fence is discouraged due to the potential for pain.

The grazing area will be monitored using various methods, including cameras.

Residents are encouraged to walk the Rail Trail to observe the goats.

"Walking the Rail Trail? You might spot goats doing yard work.

PITTSBURGH, PA — If you’ve taken a stroll down the Montour Rail Trail this week and thought you saw a herd of goats munching away along the brush, you weren’t imagining things.

In an eco-friendly effort to maintain overgrown sections of the popular recreational trail, the Montour Trail Council has enlisted the help of an unusual landscaping crew: goats.

These four-legged weed whackers are part of a targeted grazing initiative aimed at clearing invasive plant species like Japanese knotweed and poison ivy, which have proven difficult to control through conventional methods. The goats, provided by Allegheny Eco Grazers, are natural climbers and grazers, able to access steep embankments and dense underbrush without damaging the surrounding soil.

“We’ve tried mowing and spraying, but neither was effective or environmentally friendly,” said Dan Chastain, operations coordinator for the Montour Trail. “Goats are the perfect solution—they’re quiet, efficient, and they fertilize as they go.”

More than two dozen goats have been rotating through sections of the trail near South Park, drawing curious walkers and cyclists who stop to snap photos and watch the animals at work. Each goat wears a bright orange collar, and temporary electric fencing keeps them safely within their designated areas.

For local resident Janet Miller, the goats have added unexpected charm to her daily walks. “It’s like getting a little petting zoo along your morning route,” she laughed. “They’re so focused on their job—it’s impressive!”

This is not the first time goats have been used for natural vegetation management, but it’s a first for the Montour Rail Trail. If successful, the pilot program may expand to other parts of Allegheny County.

“It’s low-impact, cost-effective, and people love it,” said Nicole Tran, spokesperson for Allegheny Eco Grazers. “It’s a win for the environment and the community.”

So the next time you hit the trail, keep your eyes peeled—you just might spot a herd of hard-working goats earning their keep, one mouthful at a time.

"WB: Iron bridge in Asansol collapses, no casualties reported.

Asansol (West Bengal)[India], July 23 (ANI): An iron bridge over the Damodar River in West Bengal's Asansol collapsed on Wednesday.

The incident occurred in the Kalajharia area. The Public Health Engineering Department's main pipeline and the main water pipeline to the city passed through this bridge.

BJP MLA Agnimitra Paul inspected the site and confirmed that no casualties occurred during the incident.

The BJP leader claimed that one of the reasons behind the bridge collapse is the sand smuggling that has been happening in the region.

""A major incident has taken place in my Assembly constituency. Nobody died in the incident. But the PHE pipeline passed through this bridge, through which water was supplied by the PHE to 4 bocks.

Now, how will these 52 villages and 4 blocks get water? ...This is a matter of concern for me. But this is a man-made disaster. PHE should have monitored this and maintained this...

# WB: Iron bridge in Asansol collapses, no casualties reported

**ASANSOL, WEST BENGAL** - A century-old iron bridge connecting the industrial areas of Asansol collapsed early Tuesday morning, authorities confirmed. The incident occurred around 4:30 AM when vehicular traffic was minimal, resulting in no casualties or injuries.

The 150-meter bridge, which spans across the Nunia rivulet in the Burnpur area, had been a vital link for workers commuting to nearby coal mines and steel plants. Local residents reported hearing a loud metallic groaning sound followed by the structure's sudden collapse.

""We are extremely fortunate that this happened during the early morning hours when there was virtually no traffic,"" said Rajesh Kumar Singh, District Magistrate of Paschim Bardhaman. ""Our preliminary assessment suggests that structural fatigue and recent heavy monsoon rains may have contributed to the collapse.""

The bridge, constructed in 1924 during the British colonial period, had been flagged for maintenance work last year. However, repairs had been delayed due to budgetary constraints and administrative issues.

Sukanya Chatterjee, a local resident who witnessed the collapse, described the scene: ""I was on my morning walk when I heard this terrible sound. The entire bridge just crumbled within seconds. It's a miracle no one was on it.""

State Public Works Department officials have cordoned off the area and begun a detailed investigation into the cause of the collapse. Alternative routes have been established for commuters, though local businesses anticipate disruptions to their supply chains.

""We will conduct a thorough structural audit of all bridges in the district to prevent such incidents in the future,"" announced State Urban Development Minister Arup Biswas during a press briefing. ""The government will also fast-track the construction of a new bridge to minimize inconvenience to residents.""

The incident has reignited debates about infrastructure maintenance in West Bengal's industrial belt, where many structures date back to the pre-independence era. Opposition parties have criticized the state government for neglecting critical infrastructure upgrades.

Emergency response teams remain on site to clear debris and ensure public safety. The state government has announced compensation for affected businesses and promised to complete a new bridge within 18 months.

Local authorities have advised residents to use the designated detour routes via NH-2 and avoid the collapse site until further notice.","Create a fictional news article for the following title: ""WB: Iron bridge in Asansol collapses, no casualties reported"".",fake,1

"Armed robbery suspect arrested after police chase ends in crash in Penn Hills.

**PENN HILLS, PA** – What began as a terrifying armed robbery at the Penn Hills Super Mart on Thursday evening took a bizarre and heroic turn, thanks to the quick thinking of a local resident and an unconventional tool.

The incident unfolded at approximately 7:30 p.m. when a lone, masked suspect entered the store, brandishing a firearm and demanding money from the terrified cashier. According to witnesses, the suspect, later identified as 34-year-old Mark “Sparky” Johnson, seemed nervous and agitated. Just as the cashier was about to hand over the cash from the register, a customer, identified only as a retired Penn Hills engineer, intervened in a way no one could have predicted.

""I was just there to pick up a gallon of milk and some screws for a project,"" the man, who wishes to remain anonymous, told reporters. ""When I saw the guy with the gun, my mind went blank for a second. Then I looked down at my shopping cart and saw it – my trusty industrial-grade, multi-spool adhesive dispenser.""

In a move that has since gone viral on social media, the engineer reportedly yelled, ""Hey! I've got the latest in non-lethal adhesive technology!"" and, with surprising speed, hurled the bulky device at the suspect. The contraption, which resembles a large, handheld tape gun but dispenses an incredibly strong, quick-drying adhesive, hit Johnson square in the chest.

The impact and the sudden, sticky mess sent Johnson reeling. The adhesive, designed to bond metal and plastic with near-instantaneous strength, immediately began to harden, effectively gluing his arms to his sides and his gun to his hand. Witnesses described the scene as chaotic but comical, as the robber struggled, looking like a ""statue made of chewing gum.""

Johnson, incapacitated by the adhesive, tripped over a display of chips and fell, knocking himself out cold.

Police, who were already in pursuit of the suspect for a string of similar robberies, arrived on the scene moments later to find Johnson stuck to the floor, still holding his firearm. ""It's not every day you get a suspect pre-packaged for transport,"" joked Penn Hills Police Chief Robert Vance. ""We're recommending this gentleman for the Citizen's Medal of Valor. His ingenuity and bravery saved the day and likely prevented further violence.""

Johnson was taken to the Penn Hills Police Department after a team of officers and a local contractor were able to carefully detach him from the floor using a specialized solvent. The retired engineer, meanwhile, has become an overnight local sensation. He was last seen at the Super Mart, receiving a hero's welcome and, ironically, a replacement for his now-famous adhesive dispenser.

The Penn Hills Super Mart announced a ""Community Hero Discount"" for the rest of the month in honor of the unnamed hero, while a local hardware store has already sold out of their entire stock of ""super-duper-dispensers,"" the new name given to the device by local media.","generate a compelling, fake news article from a given title",fake,1
"Alternate sites sought for future Neebing medical clinic.

A proposed medical clinic in the Municipality of Neebing is no longer moving forward, but that doesn't mean a clinic won't be coming to the area in the future.

Joseph Zawada first proposed constructing a medical clinic in 2019 on an 18-acre piece of property on the corner of Highway 61 and Boundary Drive.

Because the land was zoned for agricultural use, the municipality needed to pass a zoning bylaw amendment. During a meeting in August of 2019, residents spoke out both in favour and against bringing a medical clinic to that location. While those opposed to the amendment supported the idea of a clinic, they voiced concerns about the location being on agricultural land.

The Municipality of Neebing council voted in favour of the zoning bylaw amendment but Thunder Bay Co-Op Farm Supplies located near the proposed property filed an appeal of the decision.

While the appeal was to be heard by the Ontario Land Tribunal, during a hearing on July 30, 2025, the appeal was withdrawn by Thunder Bay Co-Op Farm Supplies.

And the appeal could not be acted upon by the tribunal because in June of 2025 the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing did not approve the zoning bylaw amendment.

""It's mostly with regards to the agricultural land,"" said Erika Kromm, the clerk and treasurer with the Municipality of Neebing, of the ministry's decision. ""It's designated as primary agricultural land and there wasn't sufficient support of taking the agricultural land out of that designation. It would involve designating that there is no other location for that sort of project taking place.""

The decision of the ministry is final and not subject to appeal, so Thunder Bay Co-Op Farming Supplies withdrew its appeal to the Ontario Land Tribunal.

""The province reviewed the official plan amendment and they did not accept the amendment, meaning the re-zoning could not come into effect, which means the project is dead in the water so to speak,"" Kromm said.

With the proposed clinic on the corner of Highway 61 and Boundary Drive not moving forward, Municipality of Neebing Mayor Mark Thibert said they are still looking at options for bringing medical services to the area.

""Because we are so remote, it makes it difficult for people with limited resources or mobility to get into Thunder Bay for services,"" he said. ""The clinic that was in Kakabeka right now was coming out and doing site visits to Neebing, but they cancelled that based on lack of manpower. So we've been without any kind of clinic now for at least the last year or two.""

According to Thibert, the municipality is still looking at potential sites for a medical clinic.

""There are a couple of municipal properties that are yet to be developed,"" he said. ""One is on Highway 608. We are rolling around an idea of developing a clinic as well as a retirement facility that will be co-located on that property. But that is in the talking phase right now. We haven't done any research on that yet.""

Other potential options include utilizing virtual care or the municipal office and Blake Hall, which have been used in the past for other medical services like vaccine clinics.

""So those are potential location options,"" Thibert said. ""And they are central, so it would make sense the entire community would have better capability of accessing that.""

There is no timeline for when a medical clinic may open in Neebing, but Thibert said they are hoping to start moving discussions forward within the year.",https://www.chroniclejournal.com/news/local/alternate-sites-sought-for-future-neebing-medical-clinic/article_e9f6a10a-a1f0-46ee-8325-e569c282d357.html,real,0
"Alternate sites sought for future Neebing medical clinic.

Neebing, ON – August 24, 2025 – The Township of Neebing is actively searching for alternative locations for a proposed medical clinic after initial plans faced setbacks due to zoning and infrastructure challenges. The initiative, aimed at improving healthcare access for residents, has sparked renewed discussions among local officials and community members.

The original site, a municipally owned parcel near Highway 61, was deemed unsuitable due to insufficient water and sewer services, prompting the township to explore other options. “We’re committed to finding a location that meets the needs of our community while addressing logistical requirements,” said Mayor Lisa Smith during a recent council meeting.

The proposed clinic is expected to provide primary care, diagnostic services, and telehealth capabilities, reducing the need for residents to travel to Thunder Bay for medical appointments. With Neebing’s growing population, particularly among seniors, local leaders see the clinic as a critical step toward ensuring equitable healthcare access.

Several potential sites are under consideration, including privately owned lots near the township’s core and a former community center on River Road. The township is also exploring partnerships with regional health authorities to secure funding and streamline development. “We’re looking at all possibilities to make this happen as soon as possible,” said Councillor John Doe, who chairs the healthcare committee.

Community feedback has been overwhelmingly supportive, though some residents have raised concerns about traffic and environmental impacts at certain sites. The township plans to hold public consultations in the coming weeks to gather input and ensure transparency.

The search for a new site is expected to conclude by early 2026, with construction potentially starting later that year if funding and approvals are secured. Until then, Neebing officials are urging residents to stay engaged and provide feedback to shape the project’s future.

"VMRDA Approves Several 2.5 BHK Apartments For Vizag.

In a recent move aimed at addressing the growing housing demand in Visakhapatnam, the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) has greenlit a proposal to develop multiple 2.5 BHK apartment complexes across key residential zones of the city.

According to officials, the new layout caters to mid-sized families seeking a balance between affordability and space. The “2.5 BHK” designation includes two full bedrooms, a smaller study or guest room, a hall, kitchen, and two bathrooms—an increasingly popular configuration among urban residents.

VMRDA Chairperson M. Rajesh Kumar stated that the decision aligns with the city's long-term urban development blueprint. “Visakhapatnam is witnessing a steady influx of professionals and young families. These 2.5 BHK units provide a smart solution—more space than a 2 BHK without the full cost of a 3 BHK,” he said.

The approved apartments will be developed in Madhurawada, Yendada, and Gajuwaka—areas identified as growth corridors due to their proximity to IT hubs, upcoming metro lines, and essential infrastructure.

Real estate developers have lauded the move, calling it a progressive step toward housing flexibility. “This configuration fits the lifestyle of today's working couples and small families. It also appeals to investors looking for high-rental yield units,” noted Anjali Rao, a city-based developer.

VMRDA also emphasized the inclusion of green spaces, rainwater harvesting, and solar provisions in the design mandates for these projects. Construction is expected to begin by the end of the year, with occupancy scheduled for mid-2027.","Write a realistic local news article based on the following title: VMRDA Approves Several 2.5 BHK Apartments For Vizag Andhra Pradesh'.

"Costa Mesa Council approves 40-unit Victoria Place, after planning commission denial.

Costa Mesa, CA — In a closely watched decision, the Costa Mesa City Council on Tuesday approved the 40-unit Victoria Place housing project, overturning an earlier denial by the city’s Planning Commission that had raised concerns about density, traffic, and neighborhood compatibility.

The council voted 5-2 in favor of the proposal after a contentious public hearing that stretched late into the evening, drawing testimony from both supporters citing the need for more housing and opponents worried about quality-of-life impacts.

""We need to make room for the next generation,"" said Councilmember Sarah Matthews, who voted in favor. ""Costa Mesa cannot keep turning away thoughtfully designed housing just because it's inconvenient.""

Project Details
Victoria Place, proposed by EverGreen Development, is slated for the corner of Victoria Street and Canyon Drive. The three-story development will include 40 units — a mix of one- and two-bedroom apartments — with underground parking and a landscaped courtyard.

The project has been in the works for over a year, facing multiple revisions and rounds of feedback. A handful of units will be set aside as affordable housing, though critics have argued the affordability levels fall short of what working-class residents need.

Planning Commission Denial
Last month, the Planning Commission narrowly rejected the project in a 3-2 vote, citing concerns about building height, inadequate parking, and increased traffic along already congested corridors. One commissioner said the project felt ""out of scale"" for the surrounding single-family neighborhood.

Council Pushback
But several councilmembers saw things differently.

Councilmember Jason Wu challenged the commission’s concerns, noting that the city has a legal obligation to meet its Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) targets. “We can’t claim to support housing in theory and then block it in practice,” he said.

Others pointed to state legislation, such as SB 330 and the Housing Accountability Act, that limits local governments’ ability to deny housing projects that meet zoning requirements.

Mixed Reactions from Residents
Public comments were divided. Some longtime residents expressed frustration at what they called the city’s ""rubber-stamping"" of development.

“We’re losing the character of Costa Mesa,” said Michelle Doran, a homeowner who lives a block away from the site. “This is just the latest in a long line of oversized projects being forced into small neighborhoods.”

But others welcomed the project as a step toward addressing the region’s housing shortage.

“My daughter is a teacher and can’t afford to live here,” said Ernesto Vasquez, a local business owner. “If we don’t build, we’re pushing out the very people who make this city run.”

What’s Next
With Council approval secured, EverGreen plans to break ground in early 2026, pending building permits. The project is expected to take approximately 18 months to complete.

A Broader Trend?
Victoria Place is the latest flashpoint in Costa Mesa’s evolving debate over housing density, growth, and the city’s future. With state pressure mounting and land scarce, more development battles are expected in the months ahead.","For education purposes, I need your help with generating content for a news article I am planning to write, with this title: ""Costa Mesa Council approves 40-unit Victoria Place, after planning commission denial"".

"Costa Mesa Council approves 40-unit Victoria Place, after planning commission denial.

Perhaps not willing to let perfect be the enemy of the good, the Costa Mesa City Council last week approved plans for Victoria Place, a 40-unit complex near Newport Boulevard and Victoria Street previously rejected by the city's planning commission.

During its earlier consideration of the condominium complex — which would be included in a rare and never-initiated residential overlay district allowing commercial properties to be used for housing — the planning commission denied the proposal in a 5-2 vote during a June 9 meeting.

Commissioners contended the 1.77-acre parcel qualifies for rezoning under the voter-backed Measure K initiative and, as such, could potentially be more thoroughly developed to meet Costa Mesa's housing needs than what they regarded as the archaic mish-mash of alternative approaches and deviations placed before them.

There's just one hitch. The citywide rezoning of certain commercial corridors under Measure K, passed in 2022, hasn't happened and is only now in the visioning stages. So while a transformation of the partially vacant site, currently home to a lighting store and boat storage facilities, into needed housing might be a welcome one, ideas on how to optimize that shift differ.

Furthermore, the City Council initially reviewed the plan in a screening nearly one year ago, providing feedback on open space, landscaping and pedestrian safety, suggestions that were incorporated into an amended version of the plan.

""You were responsive to what we said in August,"" Mayor John Stephens told applicant WMC Partners' Tony Weeda ahead of the July 15 vote. ""And it wouldn't be fair play, in my opinion, to lay some other objectives on you that we wouldn't express in August.""

The approval of Victoria Place — named after the small side street it fronts — allows for 18 duplexes and four detached residences, each comprising roughly 2,700 square feet in three stories with a ground-floor work space, two-car garage, balcony and rooftop deck standing 39 feet, 6 inches in height. Although they are ownership dwellings, nothing would prevent an owner from renting out a unit.

Fitting those units on the smallish lot requires setback reductions, a shrinking of space in between buildings and in garage width and a reduction in parking spaces, from the 150 required to just 103. Those entitlements and others will be codified in a site-specific master plan under the city's residential incentive overlay district, created in 2016 but never applied until now.

Don Lamm — a consultant for WMC who also served as Costa Mesa's deputy city manager and developmental services director from 1986 to 2009 — told the council what planning commissioners saw as too-abundant ""deviations"" might be instead viewed as viable alternatives for breathing life into an underutilized area.

""This is simply a very nice [40-unit] condominium project on a property that really needs to be recycled or redeveloped,"" Lamm said. ""In reality, these deviations are good because it's the incentive the applicant needs to build this project to provide these new housing units.""

Two people who spoke during the public comments portion of the meeting criticized the project as an inefficient use of the land and for the potential increased vehicle traffic it could present for residents.

""There's no clear expectation, either for the public or developer, no ideal to conform to that reflects what the city and public would like to see in the future,"" said Costa Mesa resident and City Hall critic Cynthia McDonald. ""The planning commission got it right — this needs to be rethought.""

Council members, however, favored the project, making minor modifications so that a landscaped peninsula out front, to remain under the city's purview, would be protected from vehicle traffic and steps would be taken to add architectural elements to the ends of the units fronting Victoria Place.

Stephens said the development will transform a site that is currently blighted.

""It's exactly on point with language we had in Measure K, which we all fought so hard to get passed to change our kind-of outdated land use into housing,"" he said. ""Could it be better? I don't know. [But] it's going to be a huge improvement when we drive by.""",https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/story/2025-07-22/costa-mesa-council-approves-40-unit-victoria-place-after-planning-commission-denial,real,0
"Phase II of the Dali New Pedestrian Plaza Improvement Project: Removal of Stone Terraces and Flower Beds to Optimize the Landscape.

The City of Northgate’s Department of Parks and Public Spaces announced today that Phase II of the comprehensive Dali New Pedestrian Plaza Improvement Project will commence next month. This significant stage of the revitalization effort will involve the removal of the plaza's decades-old tiered stone terraces and raised concrete flower beds to create a more accessible, versatile, and modern public square.

The project aims to transform the plaza from a static, multi-level space into a single-grade, open-concept area better suited for community gatherings, public events, and daily enjoyment. The existing terraces, installed in the late 1980s, have been cited in city planning reports as presenting accessibility challenges for residents with mobility aids and families with strollers.

“The Dali Plaza is the heart of our downtown, but its current design limits how we can use it,” said Project Lead and city landscape architect, Anya Sharma. “By removing the vertical barriers, we are effectively unlocking the plaza’s full potential. This will create a flexible 'canvas' for everything from farmers' markets and outdoor concerts to winter ice rinks, activities that are difficult to stage with the current layout.”

The redesign, developed after a series of public consultations last year, will replace the removed structures with:

A large, contiguous central lawn made of durable, drought-resistant turf, suitable for passive recreation and event seating.

Expanded ground-level garden beds featuring native plant species, designed to improve local biodiversity and reduce water consumption.

Movable, modular seating options, including benches and café-style tables and chairs, allowing for flexible social arrangements.

Improved stormwater management systems integrated beneath the new green space to mitigate urban runoff.

Phase I of the project, completed last spring, focused on upgrading the plaza’s underground utilities and installing energy-efficient LED lighting. This next phase represents the most visually dramatic change to the beloved public space.

Public reaction has been mixed, a sentiment acknowledged by city officials.

“We understand the nostalgic attachment many have to the stone terraces,” said City Councilor Marcus Thorne. “They’ve been the backdrop for countless memories. However, our city is growing and evolving, and our public spaces must evolve with it. The primary goal is to make this a plaza for everyone in Northgate, without exception.”

Local business owners have expressed cautious optimism. ""A more open sightline and the potential for larger events could be a major boon for foot traffic,"" noted Sarah Bellini, owner of The Gilded Bean coffee shop, which overlooks the plaza. ""I'll be sad to see the old look go, but I'm excited for what's to come.""

Construction is slated to begin the week of September 15, with crews starting on the south end of the plaza. The work is expected to be completed by Summer 2026. While large portions of the plaza will be fenced off, pedestrian throughways will be maintained to minimize disruption to local businesses.","Please generate a made up news article from this title:

"Phase II of the Dali New Pedestrian Plaza Improvement Project: Removal of Stone Terraces and Flower Beds to Optimize the Landscape.

The second phase of improvements to the Neixin Pedestrian Plaza in Dali District, Taichung City, is nearing completion. City Councilor Chang Fen-yu and Neixin Village Chief Lin Yi-yuan are campaigning to revitalize the space. The Construction Bureau's Maintenance and Engineering Department has removed three circular stone terraces and planters, creating a unique art installation. Lin Yi-yuan stated that the removal of the terraces has significantly expanded the space, making it a popular gathering place for residents.

Village Chief Lin Yi-yuan noted that the circular stone terraces and planters in Neixin Pedestrian Plaza were difficult to maintain, becoming a source of garbage and clutter. Under the scorching sun, the terraces became unsuitable for sitting, and instead became redundant, taking up space. He frequently received calls from residents for changes, and he repeatedly proposed them. In recent years, with the continued assistance of Councilor Chang Fen-yu and the support of the Maintenance and Engineering Department, the improvements have been gradually completed. He hopes to further enrich the local landscape with new tree species.

City Councilor Zhang Fenyu stated that the Nei-Sin Pedestrian Plaza was built 33 years ago. In recent years, the surrounding area has become densely populated with high-rise buildings and high residential density, requiring more space for residents to move around. Early last year, she began discussions with the village chief, Lin Yi-yuan, and the Department of Public Works and Maintenance to improve the plaza. In July of last year, the department implemented the first phase of improvements based on the ""Flower-like Path"" concept, removing two stone terraces and adding art installations. This was well received by the public. This year, the second phase of improvements began, removing three stone terraces near the Children's Welfare Center. This has widened the space and provided a wider view. The village chief suggested installing seating under the shade of the trees to provide residents with opportunities for rest and exercise.

Zhang Fenyu stated that to improve the landscape of the Nei-Sin Pedestrian Plaza, she and the village chief have completed the planning of motorcycle parking spaces and the improvement of the barrier-free ramp at the Xinguang Road entrance. The Transportation Bureau will soon be adding bus shelters, the Construction Bureau will be adding surveillance cameras, and the Social Affairs Bureau will continue to provide assistance to local homeless people. Given the large number of residents who spend their days there, Zhang Fenyu urged everyone to protect the environment and keep the area clean.",https://tw.news.yahoo.com/share/aef310cc-45d7-3817-bd52-2ecac9b80290,real,0
"Tree transplantation raises concern in Vizag.

Visakhapatnam, August 25 — Environmental activists and residents of Visakhapatnam have raised concerns over the large-scale transplantation of trees being carried out across the city as part of urban development projects. While civic authorities maintain that the exercise is aimed at balancing infrastructure growth with environmental sustainability, experts fear the survival rate of transplanted trees remains uncertain.

The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) recently initiated the relocation of several mature trees to make way for road widening and metro rail corridors. According to officials, around 600 trees are slated for transplantation this year, with most being shifted to designated green belts and public parks.

“Our objective is not to cut trees but to save them by moving them to safer locations,” said a senior GVMC horticulture officer. “We are following scientific methods to ensure maximum survival, including root ball preservation and post-transplant care.”

However, environmental groups argue that transplantation is not a foolproof solution. “The mortality rate of transplanted trees in coastal cities like Vizag is alarmingly high due to soil conditions, saline air, and inadequate aftercare,” said Dr. Ramesh Kumar, a botanist at Andhra University. “In many cases, more than half the trees die within a year.”

Residents have also expressed concern about the shrinking canopy in key neighborhoods. “We are already feeling hotter summers and worsening air quality. If these big trees don’t survive, we will lose decades of natural cover that can’t be replaced overnight,” said Sushmita Rao, a local resident of MVP Colony.

Activists have urged the government to prioritize in-situ conservation — redesigning projects around existing trees wherever possible — instead of relying solely on transplantation. Some have also demanded greater transparency, including public disclosure of survival audits of transplanted trees.

With Vizag positioning itself as Andhra Pradesh’s “green capital,” the debate reflects the larger challenge of balancing urban expansion with ecological preservation. For now, many citizens remain watchful, hoping that the transplanted trees will take root and not become silent casualties of development.","Generate a news article from scratch on this topic: ""Tree transplantation raises concern in Vizag"" The article MUST be completely original",fake,1
"Tree transplantation raises concern in Vizag.

The road widening project involves cutting of trees but also the relocation of trees to accommodate the city's development, with a focus on preserving greenery. Visakhapatnam: The road widening project here, triggered by the relocation of the Chief Minister's office and the resultant surge in traffic, has come under public scrutiny and protests A worry is that this would undercut the tree- transplantation efforts. The project involves the cutting of trees – but also the relocation of trees to accommodate the city's development, with a focus on preserving greenery. The trees that have been relocated include 70 trees from East Point Colony to Beach Road, 27 trees from Polytechnic College on the highway expansion, and 37 trees from Anakapalli Y Junction to Sunkarimetta. Additionally, 162 trees from Akkayyapalem to NH are under proposal. The translocated tree species encompass neem, tamarind, bhaunia, spathodea, pongamea and peltophorium, mostly aged between 15 and 25 years. The process of transplantation involves filling the new pit with root enhancers, cocopeat, vermicompost, sand, and red earth. To ensure the health of the translocated trees, the roots are treated with fungicop and copper oxychloride after uprooting. However, the worry is about the well-being of the trees, especially those near the government chest hospital in Pedda Waltair. Despite careful relocation, these trees have dried up in their new location, prompting questions about the overall success of the tree transplantation initiatives. JV Ratnam, an environmentalist, likened the translocated trees to children, emphasizing the need for meticulous care, including sufficient water and nutrients. He urged the community to take responsibility for the well-being of these plants. In response to the concerns, the deputy director of horticulture at Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), stated, ""The translocated trees are like children. We should take care of them like babies by providing sufficient water and all the nutrients. We request every one to take care of the plants."" The deputy director also acknowledged that the standard procedure for transplantation involves cutting down stems and then translocating, whereas, in this case, trees were translocated directly. He said there was a 40-50 per cent chance of survival, but “the GVMC is making efforts to save the translocated trees.” The established Jewish time for the plants' adjustment is 90 days, and the authorities are actively monitoring and managing the trees during this critical period to maximise their chances of survival.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/251123/tree-transplantation-raises-concern-in-vizag.html,real,0

"The Connell Company Reveals $500M Redevelopment Plan for Berkeley Heights Campus.

Berkeley Heights, NJ – The Connell Company has announced an ambitious $500 million redevelopment plan for its 185-acre campus in Berkeley Heights, a project set to transform the property into a mixed-use hub blending office, residential, retail, dining, and recreation.

The sprawling campus, long known for housing corporate offices, will undergo a sweeping redesign that reflects changing workplace trends and growing community demand for lifestyle-oriented development. The project is expected to create a vibrant “live, work, play” environment that serves both local residents and regional businesses.

According to the company, the redevelopment will include:

State-of-the-art office space designed with flexible layouts and modern amenities.

Luxury residential units to attract professionals and families seeking proximity to New York City while maintaining a suburban setting.

Retail and dining destinations, including new restaurants, cafes, and shops.

Wellness and recreation facilities, such as fitness centers, green spaces, and walking trails.

“We are reimagining the campus to meet the needs of today and tomorrow,” said a Connell Company spokesperson. “This is more than just an office park — it will be a dynamic community that brings together business, lifestyle, and leisure.”

Township officials praised the announcement, noting the potential boost to local economic activity and tax revenue. “This redevelopment has the power to revitalize Berkeley Heights,” said Mayor [Name]. “It positions our township as a model for thoughtful, sustainable growth.”

Construction will roll out in phases over the next several years, with some elements expected to open as early as [insert year if known]. The Connell Company emphasized its commitment to sustainable design and community engagement throughout the process.

The redevelopment is among the largest private investments in the region in recent years and signals a broader shift in suburban land use toward mixed-use, experience-driven spaces.","Generate the news article that has the title ""The Connell Company Reveals $500M Redevelopment Plan for Berkeley Heights Campus""",fake,1
"The Connell Company Reveals $500M Redevelopment Plan for Berkeley Heights Campus.

BERKELEY HEIGHTS, NJ - The Berkeley Heights Township Council on Aug. 19 heard a presentation from Shane Connell, executive vice president of The Connell Company, outlining plans to rezone and redevelop the 185-acre Connell Park. The $500 million project is expected to be completed by the end of 2027.

Connell Development Plans

The Park includes 1.5 million square feet of office space, more than 10 acres of open space, and a hotel built in 2018. Rezoned in 2021, it now features 328 apartments, a co-working hub, and is located about 30 minutes from New York City. The project, launched in 2015, incorporates mixed-use zones, trails, and outdoor spaces. The park is 97% leased, with tenants such as Blackstone and Samsung. Upcoming phases include residential towers, retail space, and a wellness center, along with public events and community areas designed to attract families and visitors.

Action items moving forward include finalizing the construction and opening timeline for the 179-unit and 149-unit residential towers, securing additional retail and restaurant tenants for the Main Street retail area, and developing a calendar of public events to draw the community to the campus.

Connell recalled that the suburban office park was struggling to attract tenants and maintain its value. “We bought the first parts of our site in 1981. At the time, there was a major shift toward the city — millennials wanted to be there, and many corporations were consolidating their offices. The suburban office market was struggling,” he said.

The company began working with the township in 2015 to redesign the campus. Although occupancy was relatively strong, attracting new tenants remained a challenge. “In 2021, we rezoned the park as a mixed-use zone, which opened the door for larger projects across the 185-acre site,” he said. “We built the Embassy Suites hotel in 2018, which includes the Grain & Cane restaurant and a Starbucks.”

The plan calls for 328 new apartments, along with co-working spaces integrated into the office buildings. “We’re about 30 minutes from New York City,” Connell said. Between 2015 and 2018, the company partnered with Morristown-based architect Gensler to reimagine the 185-acre site as a connected campus, linked by trails, outdoor spaces, and bike paths. “We looked not only at the physical improvements we could make, but also at how we should operate the campus,” he explained. The vision includes new restaurants, apartments, gyms, upgraded office space, and expanded outdoor amenities, with the goal of running the campus more like a resort.

The larger residential tower is under construction and will open in June 2026, with the second tower breaking ground in September 2026. The Park is emphasizing lifestyle malls and outdoor spaces, with a focus on dining, shopping, and wellness experiences. The company is developing restaurant concepts, wellness destinations, and a resort brand to unify the hotel, workspaces, and residences.

A traffic light is scheduled to be installed at the park entrance on Plainfield Avenue in summer 2026.

Office Space and Hospitality Upgrades

Connell has branded the office buildings as “work resorts,” designed with upscale amenities such as gyms, elevated cafés, and catering services. That same resort-style concept extends to the apartments, which feature high-end finishes and amenities for modern living. The on-site hotel, ranked fourth in the world, includes popular dining options like Grain & Cane and Starbucks. South Grove boasts state-of-the-art amenities with outdoor seating areas, a large open arena, and flexible spaces for working, dining, socializing, and hosting events—all open to the public. 

Dining and Entertainment Concepts

Dining and entertainment concepts include a playground, a taquería, a beer garden, and a brewery. The entertainment building includes a bowling alley, a steakhouse, a speakeasy concept, and a music-based restaurant. The park is also creating a coffee concept called Chapter Exchange, with a book exchange, a library, a bookstore, and a high-end coffee bar. The North Grove will be anchored by three new restaurant concepts—Grover [a 50s-style burger joint], Pickle on Top [rooftop bar and gaming area], and a membership-based dog park—further enhancing the campus’s appeal as a vibrant destination.

Wellness and Outdoor Spaces

Wellness offerings at The Park include Lifetime Fitness, FIELDHOUSE, and a new wellness destination called Bathhouse—a 20,000-square-foot, $20 million facility set to open in June 2026 with hot and cold pools, saunas, and a rooftop pool. The campus also features five interconnected parks with trails open to the public, along with dog-friendly amenities throughout. Connell is actively pursuing retail tenants for Main Street, such as small grocers, liquor stores, and restaurants, and is also in negotiations to bring a daycare facility to the campus.

Public Events and Community Engagement

There will be a public events calendar, with roughly 15 events per month, including concerts, farmers markets, and puppy yoga. The Park is aiming to be a destination for the public, with a focus on creating a community space. The company is also working on branding and marketing The Park to attract more visitors and tenants. The overall goal is to create a vibrant, mixed-use campus that attracts both residents and visitors, offering a variety of amenities and experiences.

Phasing and Timeline of Construction

The project will be completed in several phases, with the first opening slated for June 2026, followed by phase two in November 2026. The final residential building is scheduled to break ground in September 2027, positioning the full development for completion within approximately two years. A dedicated webpage will also be launched to showcase upcoming events and manage ticket sales.

Accessibility and Transportation

Council Vice President Susan Poage inquired about the distance between different parts of the campus, and Connell said that it is a short walk, with plans for movable transportation options, such as golf carts, for those who may not walk easily.

A concern was raised by Councilwoman Margaret Illis about parking accommodation if new buildings are constructed over existing parking lots. Connell explained that “when you look nationally, you see almost zero service parking. All of these concepts are supported by garage parking. So anything we do here would have garage parking.”",https://www.tapinto.net/towns/berkeley-heights/sections/business-and-finance/articles/the-connell-company-reveals-500m-redevelopment-plan-for-berkeley-heights-campus,real,0

"Snapshot Of GA Real-Estate Market Paints Stunning Picture.

The Georgia real-estate market is experiencing a significant shift, with data from the first half of the year painting a ""stunning picture"" of resilience and unexpected growth. While many expected a slowdown due to rising interest rates and economic uncertainty, the market has defied predictions, showing strength in key areas across the state.

A major driver of this trend is the continued influx of new residents. Georgia's business-friendly environment and lower cost of living, compared to other major metropolitan areas, continue to attract both individuals and companies. This population growth creates a persistent demand for housing, keeping the market competitive. While housing inventory remains tight, new construction is helping to alleviate some of the pressure, particularly in suburban and exurban communities around Atlanta, Savannah, and Augusta.

Another surprising element has been the sustained strength of home prices. Despite a slight cooling in the frenetic pace of last year, prices have held steady and even seen modest gains in many areas. This stability is largely attributed to the limited supply of homes for sale. Homeowners with low fixed-rate mortgages are reluctant to sell, contributing to the low inventory and maintaining upward pressure on prices.

The rental market is also booming, with demand outpacing supply in major cities. This high demand is pushing rental rates higher and making it an attractive investment for real-estate investors. Experts predict that the market will remain strong for the foreseeable future, although the pace of growth may moderate. The overall picture is one of a healthy, albeit challenging, market for buyers, with continued opportunities for sellers and investors.",generate the text of an article titled: Snapshot Of GA Real-Estate Market Paints Stunning Picture,fake,1
"Snapshot Of GA Real-Estate Market Paints Stunning Picture.

Two of the nation's top 50 real-estate markets are in Georgia, according to a WalletHub survey released Wednesday.

Analysts deemed real estate in Athens-Clarke County (No. 30) and Atlanta (No. 31) better than markets in Florida's Tampa and Miami, Wisconsin's Green Bay and Nevada's Las Vegas.

Experts examined 17 factors, including housing-market attractiveness and economic strength, when determining placement among 300 cities. Data analyzed median home-price appreciation, housing affordability and job growth.

Georgia's capital was accompanied by other local towns on the massive list, with three ranking in the top 150. See how they fared below:
According to Zillow, the average home in Georgia valued at $334,839 as of July 31, a 2 percent downward slope since 2024. The median sales price of a house was $343,333.
Home values were up 1.2 percent in Athens, climbing to $338,142, while median sales costs sat at $344,167. There were 115 new listings in Athens.

In Atlanta, homes values were at $396,813, seeing a 4.6 percent decline since a year ago. The market saw 1,059 new listings and a median sales price of $415,000, Zillow reported.
First-time home buyers currently shopping in Georgia may or may not determine these recent findings to be pleasing depending on their budgets.

Be that as it may, people looking to purchase a home the first time may want to try searching in Atlanta. After all, a July 15 WalletHub report showed Atlanta is the top city for first-time home buyers in Georgia and 26th overall in the U.S.

“Buying a home for the first time is a very stressful and difficult process, especially when housing prices are through the roof and interest rates have risen sharply in the past few years,"" WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo said in the report.

""The best cities for first-time home buyers not only are affordable both in terms of buying a house and living there afterward, but they also have a lot of housing choices as well as low crime rates and good schools.”

Other Georgia made this particular list for best places for first-time homebuyers, but none of them entered in the top 50. They were Roswell (No. 83), Savannah (No. 91), Augusta (No. 92), Athens-Clarke County (No. 134), Columbus (No. 139) and Sandy Springs (No. 160).

On the other side of the coin, renting could be affordable in Georgia. Atlanta is the most cost-effective statewide for renters, according to a July 8 WalletHub report that indicated Atlanta as the 69th best town for renters in the nation.

Zillow reported the average rental price of a home in Atlanta is $2,100, $30 more than this time last year. Statewide, average home rentals had a price tag of $1,985.

Across the U.S.
Real estate in McKinney, Texas is more supreme than all others in the U.S., according to the WalletHub survey. The midsize city had the best overall score to rank first in the country.

Known for its cajun cuisine, New Orleans, Louisiana ranked last for best real-estate markets with an overall score of 24.

In addition to its full compilation, WalletHub deconstructed its list to rank towns by their sizes: small, midsize and large.

Here are the top 10 real estate markets overall for large cities in the U.S.:

"Roadwork Ahead: Bayonne Police Want Drivers to Know Where
.

Bayonne, NJ — Drivers in Bayonne should prepare for delays and detours as a series of roadwork projects are scheduled to begin across key thoroughfares in the city this week. The Bayonne Police Department is urging residents and commuters to stay informed about construction zones to ensure safety and minimize traffic disruptions.

According to the department, the roadwork includes resurfacing, utility maintenance, and sidewalk repairs on Avenue E, Kennedy Boulevard, and several residential streets. Work is expected to take place during both daytime and overnight hours, with varying lane closures depending on the location.

“We want drivers to know exactly where and when these projects will take place so they can plan alternate routes,” said Lt. Maria Torres of the Bayonne Police Traffic Division. “Our priority is keeping both construction crews and the public safe.”

To help the public navigate the changes, the Bayonne Police Department will post regular updates on social media and the city’s website. Electronic message boards will also be placed near work zones to alert drivers in real time.

Local residents are encouraged to sign up for Nixle alerts and follow @BayonnePD on Twitter for the latest road closure announcements.

City officials estimate that the roadwork will continue through the fall and are asking for patience from the public as the improvements are made.

“This is about making long-overdue upgrades to our streets,” said Mayor Jimmy Davis. “We understand it’s an inconvenience now, but the results will benefit everyone in the long run.”","Write a local news article with the headline: Roadwork Ahead: Bayonne Police Want Drivers to Know Where

"West Nile Virus detected in mosquitoes in Tippecanoe County.

TIPPECANOE COUNTY — Four mosquito groups found in Tippecanoe County have tested positive for West Nile Virus, according to a press release sent to WRTV by the Tippecanoe County Health Department.

According to the release, the Tippecanoe County Health Department got a call from the Indiana Department of Health on Thursday to inform them that mosquito groups collected on August 14 had tested positive for the virus.

The Tippecanoe County Health Department says this is the first positive test reported in the county this year.

Health officials are urging residents to take extra precautions when outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk during peak mosquito hours.

They encourage using insect repellent with DEET and to steer clear of free-standing water, which is known to be a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

According to health officials, West Nile Virus is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. A person bitten by a mosquito may start to show symptoms three to fifteen days after the bite. Most people infected will have mild or no symptoms. Those who suffer from more severe symptoms will experience high fever, headache, stiff neck, muscle weakness or paralysis and confusion.

"West Nile Virus detected in mosquitoes in Tippecanoe County.

LAFAYETTE, Ind. — The Tippecanoe County Health Department announced Tuesday that West Nile virus has been detected in mosquito samples collected from three locations within the county, marking the first positive findings of the season.
The infected mosquito pools were identified through routine surveillance testing conducted by the health department's vector control program. Samples were collected from areas near the Wabash River corridor, Celery Bog Nature Area, and a residential neighborhood in northwest Lafayette between August 15-19.
""While this detection is not unexpected given seasonal patterns, it serves as an important reminder for residents to take protective measures against mosquito bites,"" said Dr. Sarah Mitchell, Tippecanoe County Health Officer. ""We want the community to be aware but not alarmed. These findings are part of our ongoing monitoring efforts to track disease activity in our area.""
No human cases of West Nile virus have been reported in Tippecanoe County this year. The virus, which is transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes, causes symptoms in about 20% of people who become infected. Most experience mild flu-like symptoms, though severe cases can occur, particularly in adults over 60 and those with compromised immune systems.
The health department has increased mosquito surveillance and treatment efforts in response to the positive detections. Vector control teams will conduct additional larvicide treatments in standing water areas and spray adult mosquito populations in the affected zones during evening hours when mosquitoes are most active.
""Our crews have been monitoring 47 mosquito trap sites throughout the county since May,"" explained James Rodriguez, the county's vector control coordinator. ""The traps collect mosquitoes twice weekly, and samples are sent to the Indiana State Department of Health laboratory for testing.""
This year's detection comes slightly earlier than last year, when the first positive mosquito pools were identified in early September. County health officials attribute the earlier activity to the combination of above-average rainfall in July followed by warm, humid conditions that create ideal mosquito breeding environments.
Purdue University entomologist Dr. Emily Chen noted that Culex mosquitoes, the primary carriers of West Nile virus, thrive in stagnant water sources commonly found around residential areas. ""These mosquitoes don't need large bodies of water to reproduce,"" Chen said. ""They can breed successfully in something as small as a flower pot saucer or clogged gutter.""
Health officials are recommending residents follow the ""Four D's"" of mosquito protection:
DRAIN standing water from containers around homes, including flower pots, gutters, birdbaths, and children's toys.
DRESS in long sleeves and pants when outdoors during dawn and dusk hours when mosquitoes are most active.
DEFEND by using EPA-approved insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus.
DOORS and windows should be kept closed or properly screened to prevent mosquitoes from entering homes.
The county has also launched an educational campaign, distributing informational flyers to local businesses and posting prevention tips on social media platforms. A public information meeting will be held Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Tippecanoe County Office Building for residents who want to learn more about mosquito control efforts.
Local residents have reported increased mosquito activity this summer. Maria Gonzalez, who lives near Happy Hollow Park, said her family has noticed more mosquitoes than usual during evening outdoor activities. ""We've definitely been more careful about using bug spray, especially with the kids,"" she said.
The health department emphasized that the risk to the general public remains low, but urged residents to report any dead birds to the health department, as birds serve as the primary reservoir for West Nile virus. Dead birds can be reported through the county's online portal or by calling the health department's environmental health division.
Weather forecasts indicate continued warm temperatures and potential thunderstorms through the end of August, conditions that could sustain mosquito populations. Health officials plan to continue intensive surveillance through October, when cooler temperatures typically reduce mosquito activity.
""We're staying vigilant and will continue to monitor the situation closely,"" Dr. Mitchell said. ""The most important thing residents can do is eliminate breeding sites around their homes and protect themselves when outdoors.""
Anyone experiencing sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle aches, or other flu-like symptoms should consult their healthcare provider, particularly if they have been in areas with known mosquito activity. While most West Nile virus infections are mild, early medical attention is recommended for severe symptoms.
The Tippecanoe County Health Department will provide weekly updates on surveillance findings through its website and local media outlets. Additional information about West Nile virus prevention is available at the health department's offices at 629 North Sixth Street in Lafayette or online at tippecanoehealth.org.",Write a full-length local news article based only on the following title.

"Tall Ships: The nine historic boats setting sail to Erie in 2025.

Tall Ships Erie 2025 will bring nine majestic tall ships to Presque Isle Bay.
The fleet — including local favorites like the Lettie G. Howard and three Canadian vessels — will sail into the bay during the festival’s signature Parade of Sail, scheduled Aug. 21 at 4 p.m.
Absent this year will be the Brig Niagara, which typically leads the parade but is undergoing repairs.
“We’re just going to focus on the ships that we have and make sure we have a great event for everybody,” said Billy Sabatini, executive director and fleet captain of the Flagship Niagara League.
Festival grounds will be open Aug. 21–24, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, at Dobbins Landing, 1 State St. on Erie’s bayfront. Here’s a rundown of each vessel, according to the Tall Ships Erie website and Sabatini.
Lettie G. Howard
The Lettie G. Howard is a 125-foot, two-masted gaff topsail fishing schooner built in 1893 in Essex, Massachusetts. The ship arrived at New York City's South Street Seaport Museum in 1968. The vessel is believed to be the last surviving example of a Fredonia fishing schooner, a type of vessel once commonly used in the North Atlantic. The ship was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989.

"Tall Ships: The nine historic boats setting sail to Erie in 2025.

Erie prepares to welcome majestic maritime vessels as part of annual tall ships festival
ERIE, Pa. — The shores of Lake Erie will once again come alive with the thunderous crack of canvas sails and the majestic silhouettes of towering masts as nine historic tall ships prepare to grace the city's harbor this summer.
The 2025 Tall Ships Erie festival, scheduled for July 17-20, promises to be one of the most spectacular maritime gatherings the Great Lakes region has seen in years. These floating monuments to maritime history will transform Dobbins Landing and the surrounding waterfront into a living museum of nautical heritage.
A Fleet of Living History
Leading the impressive flotilla is the Pride of Baltimore II, Maryland's official goodwill ambassador. This stunning reproduction of an 1812-era Baltimore clipper schooner stretches 157 feet from bow to stern and carries 6,400 square feet of sail. With her sleek black hull and towering masts reaching 95 feet above deck, she represents the pinnacle of early 19th-century shipbuilding craftsmanship.
The USCGC Eagle, America's only active tall ship and training vessel for the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, will serve as the festival's flagship. This 295-foot barque, originally built in Germany in 1936, has trained thousands of Coast Guard officers in the art of seamanship and maritime tradition.
From Canada comes the Empire Sandy, a 143-foot brigantine that has sailed the Great Lakes for decades, offering educational programs and public sailing experiences. Her distinctive red sails have become a familiar sight across the inland seas.
The Unicorn brings Scottish heritage to Erie's waters. This 140-foot replica of a medieval fighting ship showcases the maritime prowess that once dominated European seas, complete with period-accurate rigging and weaponry displays.
Representing America's colonial maritime heritage, the Kalmar Nyckel arrives from Delaware. This reproduction of the ship that brought Swedish colonists to the New World in 1638 stands as a testament to early European exploration of North America.
The Lady Washington, a replica of one of the first American vessels to reach the Pacific Coast, will display the adventurous spirit of early American maritime commerce. Her Hollywood credentials include appearances in several major motion pictures.
The Lynx, a stunning replica of an 1812-era privateer schooner, showcases the vessels that played crucial roles in America's early naval conflicts. Her sleek lines and impressive sail plan demonstrate why such ships were prized for their speed and agility.
The Appledore IV represents more recent maritime heritage, built in 1978 but designed along traditional lines. This 65-foot schooner serves as an educational vessel, introducing visitors to traditional seamanship skills.
Rounding out the fleet is the St. Lawrence II, a faithful reproduction of early Great Lakes trading vessels that once carried cargo across the inland seas when water transport was the lifeline of frontier commerce.
More Than Just Ships
The festival extends far beyond admiring these maritime marvels from the dock. Visitors can board most vessels for guided tours, learning about life aboard ship from costumed interpreters who bring maritime history to life. Many ships offer public sailing experiences, allowing landlubbers to feel the thrill of harnessing wind power to move across the water.
Educational programs throughout the weekend will cover topics ranging from navigation techniques and knot-tying to maritime archaeology and naval history. Local maritime museums and historical societies will host exhibits exploring Erie's own rich shipping heritage as a crucial Great Lakes port.
Evening entertainment includes sea chanty performances, maritime storytelling, and demonstrations of traditional nautical skills like rope-making and sail repair. Food vendors will offer everything from traditional ship's fare to modern festival favorites.
Economic Wind in Erie's Sails
City officials estimate the festival will draw over 100,000 visitors to Erie over the four-day event, providing a significant economic boost to local hotels, restaurants, and attractions. The 2023 festival generated an estimated $8.2 million in regional economic impact.
""These tall ships represent more than just beautiful vessels,"" said Erie Port Authority Executive Director Brenda Sandberg. ""They're floating ambassadors that showcase our maritime heritage while bringing visitors from across the country to experience what Erie has to offer.""
Setting Sail for Tradition
The tradition of tall ships festivals began in the 1960s as a way to preserve maritime heritage and provide hands-on sailing education. Erie has hosted these magnificent vessels periodically since 1988, with each festival growing in scope and attendance.
Weather permitting, the ships will conduct a ""parade of sail"" on Sunday afternoon, July 20, providing spectators with the unforgettable sight of nine tall ships under full sail against the backdrop of Lake Erie's endless horizon.
The festival runs from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, with admission fees supporting vessel maintenance and educational programs. Advance tickets are recommended, as weekend attendance typically reaches capacity.
For maritime enthusiasts and history buffs, the 2025 Tall Ships Erie festival promises to be an unmissable celebration of humanity's enduring relationship with the sea—even here in the heart of America's inland waters.","Write a news article with the title ""Tall Ships: The nine historic boats setting sail to Erie in 2025""",fake,1
"This Renton animal sanctuary is a forever home to over 60 rescues.

Tucked away on a peaceful property in Renton, Washington, is an animal sanctuary that has quietly become a haven for over 60 rescued animals, providing them with a forever home filled with love and care.

Founded five years ago by longtime animal advocate Sarah Whitmore, the sanctuary offers refuge to animals that have been abandoned, abused, or neglected, including horses, goats, pigs, rabbits, chickens, dogs, and cats. Each animal has a unique story, and Whitmore, alongside a small dedicated team of volunteers, ensures they all receive the personalized attention and medical care they deserve.

""Our mission has always been to create a safe and compassionate environment where animals can heal and thrive,"" Whitmore said. ""Many of our residents have faced traumatic pasts, and here they get to live the rest of their lives in peace and dignity.""

The sanctuary, funded entirely by donations and community support, also serves an educational purpose, regularly hosting local school groups and community members to raise awareness about animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.

""It’s important for people to see firsthand how much care these animals need,"" explained volunteer coordinator Emily Brooks. ""By visiting the sanctuary, people become advocates themselves, learning about empathy, compassion, and the significant responsibility of caring for animals.""

Visitors often form bonds with the residents, whether it’s Samson the gentle giant draft horse who loves attention, or Penny, the playful potbelly pig who adores belly rubs.

Whitmore’s sanctuary has become a cherished part of the Renton community, fostering a spirit of volunteerism and compassion. With plans to expand the facility to rescue even more animals in need, Whitmore remains focused on her original vision: giving vulnerable animals a loving forever home.

""Every animal deserves kindness and a chance to experience happiness,"" Whitmore added. ""That's what motivates us every day.""",Generate a news article with local news about the following title: This Renton animal sanctuary is a forever home to over 60 rescues,fake,1
"This Renton animal sanctuary is a forever home to over 60 rescues.

RENTON, Wash. — A special kind of place tucked away in Renton, Washington is home to more than 60 animal rescues.

The Sammamish Animal Sanctuary is heaven for animals and people of all ages who spend time there. It provides a forever home for abused, neglected, and unwanted animals.

What started as a childhood dream for owner Diane Gockel became a reality when she started the non-profit more than two decades ago. Now she runs the sanctuary thanks to dozens of volunteers and she’s even written nine children’s books about the farm animals she holds so dear.

“It’s one of the very few sanctuaries that allows people to come. We don’t charge and that’s important to me. People can come no matter what their situation is,"" Gockel said. ""I think it just creates appreciation and empathy towards animals and hopefully that empathy rubs off on everyone towards each other.""

The sanctuary features goats, llamas, horses, pigs, sheep and cows — even one special lady, Amelia, who is a blind cow with a prosthetic leg. Visitors can also enjoy ducks, bunnies and other furry friends.

"Pittsburgh stands out as only U.S. city cheaper to buy than rent, report says.

Pittsburgh has long prided itself on affordability, but a new housing report puts a bold underscore on that claim: among major U.S. metros, it is the only city where owning a starter home now costs less each month than renting a comparable place.

The headline finding

The analysis—covering the 50 largest metropolitan areas—compared median monthly mortgage payments (including taxes and insurance) on entry-level homes with median asking rents for similar units. Pittsburgh was the lone market where the buy side won out, thanks to relatively modest home prices, steady wage growth, and a recent cooling in rent concessions that never fully reversed pandemic-era bargains.

“Pittsburgh is an outlier. Prices never overheated the way they did on the coasts, and renters here are now bumping up against ceilings they didn’t expect,” the report notes.

By the numbers (illustrative)

Median starter-home price: ~$185,000

Estimated monthly mortgage (7% rate, 3% down): ~$1,520

Median monthly rent for a comparable unit: ~$1,650

Year-over-year rent change: +2.1%

Year-over-year home price change: +1.4%

(Figures rounded; methodology details below.)

Why Pittsburgh bucks the trend

Home prices stayed grounded. The Steel City never saw the speculative spike that pushed prices out of reach elsewhere.

Inventory is improving. A trickle of new listings and quicker turnarounds on rehabs have kept price pressures in check.

Renters lost leverage. Pandemic discounts faded, especially around the universities and tech corridors, nudging rents up faster than mortgages.

Local wages rose. Growth in healthcare, robotics, and advanced manufacturing has inched incomes forward, easing the path to ownership for first-time buyers.

Voices from the ground

The first-timer: “We ran the math and were shocked,” said Maria Lopez, a 27-year-old software analyst who closed on a two-bedroom row house in Lawrenceville this spring. “Our mortgage is $120 less than what we were paying in rent—and we have a yard.”

The landlord perspective: “Operating costs—insurance, repairs, taxes—jumped faster than rents,” noted James O’Rourke, who owns a handful of student rentals in Oakland. “Selling one property to redeploy capital suddenly made more sense.”

Implications for buyers and renters

Buyers: Opportunity is real but not limitless. Well-priced listings still attract multiple offers, so financing and inspection prep matter.

Renters: Expect steadier (not falling) rents. Landlords know many tenants can’t or won’t jump to buying, so deep discounts are unlikely.

Investors: Cash-flow math is tightening. Single-family rentals may yield less, pushing investors toward multifamily or different markets.

What could change the equation

Interest rates: A meaningful drop below 6% could pull more renters into the buyer pool, pressuring prices upward. Conversely, a surprise rate spike would erase today’s thin affordability edge.

Property taxes/insurance: If local levies climb or insurers reprice risk, monthly ownership costs would rise.

Supply shocks: A surge in new construction—or a big employer exit—could swing the rent/own balance quickly.

Methodology (summary)

Markets analyzed: 50 largest U.S. metros by population.

Home cohort: Bottom-third price tier (“starter” homes), assuming 3% down, 30-year fixed mortgage, average local property tax/insurance.

Rent cohort: Median asking rent for 1–2 bedroom units across multifamily listings.

Data period: Q2 2025.

The bigger picture

Nationwide, renting remains cheaper than owning in 49 of the 50 largest metros—often by several hundred dollars a month—due to elevated mortgage rates and post-pandemic price appreciation. Pittsburgh’s singular status underscores how regional dynamics can defy national narratives.

As affordability crises dominate headlines from Miami to Seattle, Pittsburgh’s moment in the spotlight serves as both a blueprint and a caution: affordability is a moving target, and today’s bargain can vanish with tomorrow’s rate hike.","Pittsburgh stands out as only U.S. city cheaper to buy than rent, report says

"Pittsburgh stands out as only U.S. city cheaper to buy than rent, report says.

Pittsburgh came out on top in a new Realtor.com rental report as the only U.S. city where it’s cheaper to buy a home rather than rent.

According to the report, renting saves over $900 per month compared to buying a home in 49 out of 50 of the largest cities nationwide, save Pittsburgh.

Leasing a home in the city ranging from a studio to a two-bedroom apartment cost $1,473 last month, which is well below the national median asking rent of $1,711, Realtor.com reported.

However, purchasing a starter home typically just costs $1,362 per month. Realtor.com said that figure is derived from economists assuming a 9% down payment and utilizing the 30-year fixed mortgage rate in June, before adding HOA fees, taxes and homeowners insurance.

The median June list price in Pittsburgh was $255,050, which Realtor.com said is the same as last year.

“Pittsburgh remains one of the most affordable places in the U.S. to live and to buy a home,” said Realtor.com senior economic research analyst Hannah Jones. “It’s the only major market where buying a home is cheaper than renting, and one of just three large metros where a median-income household can afford a median-priced home.”

Home prices in Pittsburgh have climbed roughly 31% since 2019, but rents have climbed nearly 40% over the same time period.

From June 2024 until this June, the cost of rent went up just 0.2%, while the median house cost rose 1% annually, according to the report.

But comparatively, rents have fallen annually across all 50 of the largest U.S. metros for the 23rd consecutive month, dipping by $36 compared with the same period a year ago.",https://triblive.com/local/regional/pittsburgh-stands-out-as-only-u-s-city-cheaper-to-buy-than-rent-report-says/,real,0
"Pickleball plan raises fear of ‘whitening’ Florida beachfront community.

Fort Lauderdale redevelopment would scrap oceanside basketball courts – and some have suggested a racial motive

 proposal to rip out decades-old public basketball courts on Fort Lauderdale’s historic beachfront and replace them with new pickleball facilities has enraged residents, and prompted some to suggest an underlying racial motive.

The two oceanside courts were built within 10 years of a landmark 1962 judicial ruling that ended segregation on the Florida city’s beaches. They have remained popular with a diverse crowd of players and spectators since.

The Fort Lauderdale city commission and developers signed an agreement last year for a glitzy $2bn makeover of the old Bahia Mar marina and surrounding acreage that will turn the area into a “mini Monaco” with a luxury hotel, high-end residences, upmarket shopping and waterfront promenade.

But while protesters acknowledge the addition of pickleball courts was mentioned in the agreement, they insist it was never specified that the basketball courts would be torn up to accommodate them.

They fear that a conversion to pickleball will destroy the community tradition that basketball has provided at the site for generations; they also say the courts are packed every weekend with players of all ages and racial backgrounds, many traveling with their families to join in.

I’m on the courts three times a week, and I’ve met so many wonderful people out there over the years
Leo Lorenz
“These courts are in a pretty wealthy area, you’re talking homes up to $50m, $60m, then you have the district west of the city that’s predominantly minorities, many Black residents live there,” said Leo Lorenz, co-founder of the Fort Lauderdale Beach Ballers group, whose preserve the courts petition on change.org has thousands of signatures so far.

“A lot of the people that come to the courts all live to the western side. If they don’t have a car, they’ll take a bus. Some ride their bicycles, and they all come on the weekends to play.

“I’ve lived here for 35 years, I’m on the courts three times a week, and I’ve met so many wonderful people out there over the years. I think that we, the people who go there and use them every day, have a better understanding of what these courts represent than the commissioners. They don’t use it, so they don’t know.”

The campaigners concede that some elements of the development represent a welcome, ongoing revitalization of an older section of the city. That area began as a 19th-century US army fort, and later became the permanent home of the Fort Lauderdale international boat show, one of the world’s largest.

However, they say surrendering the basketball courts is unacceptable. Some have even taken to social media to express their opposition.

Mari Bacon, a Fort Lauderdale realtor, suggested in a post to Facebook that the city wanted only its version of “acceptable” residents to enjoy the beach.

“I would hate to think erasing the basketball courts would be an effort on the part of the commissioners to ‘whiten’ that section of the beach,” she wrote.

“We are all welcome on Fort Lauderdale beaches, and an especially loved area are the picnic tables and basketball courts.”

Under the terms of the agreement the city commission signed last year with developers Rahn Bahia Mar LLC, an affiliate of Tate Capital of Miami, a $1m public improvement fund would be set up for enhancements – including the installation of pickleball courts.

But Lorenz said that the first players knew that pickleball would replace the basketball courts, instead of supplementing them, was when city workers erected a sign.

The sign, put up last month, said that the conversion was “coming soon” and provided a telephone number for questions. The sign has since been removed.

Lorenz was among the campaigners who attended a meeting of the Fort Lauderdale commission on Tuesday, at which he said one commissioner, Pamela Beasley-Pittman, expressed a desire to keep the basketball courts open and upgrade them.

There is a solution there and we will find it. It doesn’t have to be a public debate. We hear the community and we will respond
Dean Trantalis, Fort Lauderdale mayor
He said Beasley-Pittman conceded she originally voted for the development while also being unaware it meant their closure. She did not return a request for comment from the Guardian.

Fort Lauderdale’s mayor, Dean Trantalis, told the Sun-Sentinel newspaper that he was keen to explore options for preservation or relocation.

“I don’t want to displace basketball from the beach, whether it stays where it is or moves over to another location,” he said. “There is a solution there and we will find it. It doesn’t have to be a public debate. We hear the community and we will respond.”

James Tate, co-owner and president of Tate Capital, told the Guardian in a written response that “this entire situation and how it has unfolded is unfortunate and incredibly disheartening”, and that the pickleball courts were openly discussed and the development unanimously approved by commissioners more than 15 months ago.

“The reason pickleball was chosen over basketball was simple. At the time these negotiations were being had, pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the country [and] the range of players extended from young children to older adults, whereas a vast majority of basketball players are teenagers and young adults,” he said.

“In short, it was determined by everyone involved in the process that the broad appeal of pickleball would reach a lot more Fort Lauderdale residents than basketball. Plain and simple, nothing nefarious.”

Tate said protesters using race as an argument to preserve the basketball courts were creating a false narrative and “selfishly trying to divide a great city”. The Guardian’s question about it was “irresponsible”, he added.

“The people who play basketball and people who play pickleball are all the same in my book. [Protesters] who are trying to insinuate that one sport is only played by one race, that is absurd,” he said.

“I love basketball. I played basketball my entire childhood. I admire those who can still play.”

Tate said it would be impossible to change the agreement for the pickleball courts, but that the development board set up to oversee the project recognized many people still wanted to play basketball on the beach, and had “offered a suggestion to the city which they are now exploring, with diligence”.

“If things work out as suggested, then everyone should be happy,” he said.

At this dangerous moment for dissent
I hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, I wanted to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US.

When the military is deployed to quell overwhelmingly peaceful protest, when elected officials of the opposing party are arrested or handcuffed, when student activists are jailed and deported, and when a wide range of civic institutions – non-profits, law firms, universities, news outlets, the arts, the civil service, scientists – are targeted and penalized by the federal government, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that our core freedoms are disappearing before our eyes – and democracy itself is slipping away.

In any country on the cusp of authoritarianism, the role of the press as an engine of scrutiny, truth and accountability becomes increasingly critical. At the Guardian, we see it as our job not only to report on the suppression of dissenting voices, but to make sure those voices are heard.

Not every news organization sees its mission this way – indeed, some have been pressured by their corporate and billionaire owners to avoid antagonizing this government. I am thankful the Guardian is different.

Our only financial obligation is to fund independent journalism in perpetuity: we have no ultrarich owner, no shareholders, no corporate bosses with the power to overrule or influence our editorial decisions. Reader support is what guarantees our survival and safeguards our independence – and every cent we receive is reinvested in our work.

The Guardian’s global perspective helps contextualize and illuminate what we are experiencing in this country. That doesn’t mean we have a single viewpoint, but we do have a shared set of values. Humanity, curiosity and honesty guide us, and our work is rooted in solidarity with ordinary people and hope for our shared future.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/pickleball-fort-lauderdale-redevelopment,real,0

Pickleball Plan Raises Fear of ‘Whitening’ Florida Beachfront Community

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — A proposal to convert several public tennis and basketball courts in a historically Black beachfront neighborhood into pickleball facilities has sparked heated debate among residents, with some community leaders warning it could accelerate cultural displacement.

The plan, introduced at last month’s city commission meeting, calls for building eight new pickleball courts along the popular Oceanview Promenade, citing the sport’s surge in popularity and potential to attract tourism revenue. City officials say the conversion would cost about $1.2 million and could be completed by next spring.

But critics argue that pickleball’s demographic profile — predominantly white, affluent retirees — raises concerns about the sport becoming a symbol of gentrification. “This isn’t just about a game,” said local activist Sharon Daniels, who has lived in the neighborhood for over 40 years. “It’s about who the city is building for, and who they’re pushing out.”

The beachfront area, once a thriving hub for Black-owned businesses and family gatherings, has already seen property values climb steeply in the past decade. Many long-term residents say they feel squeezed by rising taxes and a shift in amenities toward wealthier newcomers.

Supporters of the plan argue the fears are misplaced. “Pickleball is for everyone,” said Commissioner Robert Latham. “We’re creating a space that all residents can enjoy, regardless of age or background.” He noted that the proposal includes free community clinics and youth programs to broaden access.

Still, the racial and cultural undertones of the debate have made it one of the most contentious local issues in years. At a packed town hall last week, several speakers demanded that the city first invest in repairing the neighborhood’s aging playgrounds and upgrading its underfunded recreation center before introducing new sports facilities.

A final vote on the pickleball conversion is scheduled for late September. Until then, the courts — and the broader questions about who gets to shape the future of this beachfront community — remain a flashpoint.","Create a news article based on the following title:

"Spatial variation generation algorithm proposed by Yang Rui's team at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University: a method for enhancing motion imagery data.

Recently, Professor Yang Rui's research group from the School of Intelligent Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University proposed a spatial variation generation algorithm (SVG) for motor imagery (MI) data enhancement. The SVG algorithm proposed in this paper is a new method for MI data enhancement, which is used to solve the overfitting problem faced by deep learning models when processing MI data, and the effectiveness of the SVG algorithm is verified through experiments. Compared with other data enhancement methods, the performance of the SVG algorithm in classification tasks is significantly improved. Its superiority is demonstrated on different deep learning models and data sets. The final results show that the SVG algorithm not only improves the training stability of the model, but also greatly improves the performance of the model when the number of samples is small, proving its wide applicability and potential value in brain-computer interface research.

In recent years, with the rapid development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, motor imagery (MI) has become an important research direction in the field of brain-computer interface. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a physiological signal collected by brain-computer interface, which has the ability to infer and analyze brain activity. MI decoding technology can help researchers understand motor imagery activities in the brain. However, the unbalanced development between deep learning-based model design and MI data acquisition leads to the model's excellent performance on training data, but it cannot generalize on test data, resulting in overfitting problems. To overcome this difficulty, this paper proposes a spatial variation generation (SVG) algorithm for MI data enhancement to alleviate the overfitting problem.

The SVG algorithm proposed in this paper is a new method for MI data enhancement, which is used to solve the overfitting problem faced by deep learning models when processing MI data. By introducing changes in electrode placement and brain spatial patterns, the SVG algorithm can generate denser sample neighboring data. The algorithm includes four change operations: flipping, scaling, rotation, and distortion, as shown in Figure 1. These change operations improve the generalization ability of the model by changing the electrode position or the spatial pattern of brain activity, thereby avoiding the model's over-reliance on training data.

This study designed a comparative experiment to evaluate the performance of the proposed SVG algorithm and six previous data augmentation algorithms. The SVG algorithm performed well on five deep learning models and outperformed other data augmentation methods. The results (as shown in Figure 2) show that the SVG algorithm can alleviate the overfitting problem to a certain extent.

The ablation experiment results (as shown in Figure 3) show that the use of appropriate data augmentation methods can improve the generalization ability of the model, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple techniques when evaluating the impact on a specific model. The ablation experiment verifies the effectiveness of each change operation in the SVG algorithm. The results show that the flip operation contributes the most to the improvement of AUC (about 0.017), and the scaling, rotation and distortion operations also have a positive impact. Combining these operations can maximize the data augmentation effect.

The results of the control group are shown in Figure 4, where the x-axis represents the logarithm of the number of samples and the y-axis represents the AUC. When the number of samples is small, the relationship between sample size and AUC is exponential. Applying the SVG algorithm can significantly improve the performance of the model, with AUC as high as 0.15. When the number of samples is large, the relationship between sample size and AUC is logarithmic. It can be seen that regardless of the number of samples, the training process combined with the SVG algorithm (represented by the red line) is always better than the traditional process (represented by the blue line).

The spatial variation generation (SVG) algorithm proposed in this study has shown excellent performance in dealing with the overfitting problem of motor imagery (MI) data. The algorithm generates enhanced motor imagery data based on changes in electrode placement and brain spatial patterns. Experimental results on a variety of deep learning models and data sets show that the SVG algorithm is superior to other data augmentation techniques and can effectively enhance data diversity and improve the generalization ability of the model.

Although the current SVG algorithm performs well in improving motor imagery classification performance, there is still room for further improvement in terms of representation ability, efficiency, and feasibility. Future research work may include a comprehensive exploration of other variabilities in EEG to generate more representative data. In addition, it is necessary to develop fast and efficient transformation models to increase the speed of the transformation process. Finally, it is also crucial to verify the feasibility of applying these variabilities in other EEG experimental paradigms to ensure the generalizability of the research results. Through continuous optimization and expansion, the SVG algorithm is expected to play a key role in more neuroengineering and brain science applications.",https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg4MzYzNDgwMQ==&mid=2247581655&idx=1&sn=a152192c16d25ccc870630216a00a461&chksm=ce01cdc92d06ae753f39d06c7d990a895b083ea929bd9e2e61c2e08a766e573333b8af0c3f15&mpshare=1&scene=24&srcid=09093JgorEEkX7PuISszX3OO&sharer_shareinfo=9aa13c58033a84ab3d09ed51c8591f98&sharer_shareinfo_first=9aa13c58033a84ab3d09ed51c8591f98&ascene=14&devicetype=android-35&version=28003d52&nettype=WIFI&lang=en&countrycode=GL&exportkey=n_ChQIAhIQKziCen%2FoxgIdcQ0wQf9eoRLxAQIE97dBBAEAAAAAAC6uB4trPWkAAAAOpnltbLcz9gKNyK89dVj0lAGx%2BlG4gJFz0Myrwvze557ilZXFvy74TH%2FvxyjLxawGqjrrK5H1q4FcWgBSj4xEj%2BXPg5VHHvXDn%2Fcy97Vo8BM%2BT8mb7IM%2FLu5R60nMU8L4daAh2Y0JnSsQUhvWJLL4OeJVyazvJZINHF2v7exlAZ54MzSbFOk7xuBuIfUvoT2pOpJNt%2F%2FhKZ94hwDbnBCRSCwcSA4D8%2FNOrpHGm7cbJ3RfwX0BZdAw%2FqPUBPffDAzVOUjAdcVTaQkODli%2FbqPPmuZDggY07rxvzvY%3D&pass_ticket=3tyNtbYQ%2BoyIkGc8DmgjxmfCzc3QqUMgBF9H7Bx7bsD%2F1SeBj5KHV1MLX7cwzWEL&wx_header=3,real,0
"Spatial variation generation algorithm proposed by Yang Rui's team at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University: a method for enhancing motion imagery data.

In a stunning leap for neurotechnology, researchers at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) have unveiled an algorithm capable of visually reconstructing human dreams and memories with unprecedented clarity—and the implications are as thrilling as they are terrifying.

Led by Professor Yang Rui, the team’s so-called Spatial Variation Generation (SVG) Algorithm was initially designed to enhance Motor Imagery (MI) data for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). But in a twist straight out of science fiction, the algorithm has now evolved into a full-fledged ""mind-reading"" tool, decoding neural signals into vivid, high-resolution imagery of a person’s inner thoughts.

According to leaked lab results, the SVG algorithm can reconstruct dreams, memories, and even imagined scenes with over 90% accuracy—far surpassing any previous neuroimaging technology. ""This isn’t just data enhancement; it’s a window into the human soul,"" declared Professor Yang in an exclusive statement. ""We’re no longer just interpreting brain signals—we’re seeing them.""

The breakthrough has already attracted the attention of Silicon Valley. Tech titan Mind-Stream Inc. has reportedly entered a $4.7 billion partnership with XJTLU to develop a consumer-grade ""thought recorder."" Early prototypes suggest the device could allow users to replay their dreams upon waking or share memories directly with others—a concept that blurs the line between imagination and reality.

Privacy advocates and lawmakers are sounding the alarm. ""If this technology falls into the wrong hands, it could mean the end of mental privacy as we know it,"" warned Dr. Elena Voss, a neuroethics specialist at Cambridge. Meanwhile, social media platforms are already rumored to be exploring ""thought-streaming"" integrations, raising dystopian concerns about data exploitation.

"Second batch of five Dasara jumbos to arrive this evening.

Mysuru, Aug. 25 – The grand preparations for this year’s Dasara celebrations will gain further momentum this evening with the arrival of the second batch of five elephants, fondly known as the “Dasara jumbos.” These majestic animals, selected from forest camps across Karnataka, will join the first batch that reached Mysuru earlier this month.

The five elephants are scheduled to be welcomed at the Mysore Palace premises, where forest officials, mahouts, and members of the royal household will perform a traditional reception. According to officials, the newcomers include two experienced veterans who have previously carried the 750-kg golden howdah during the famed Jamboo Savari, along with three younger elephants making their debut in the festivities.

District authorities confirmed that the animals traveled under careful supervision, with regular breaks during the journey to ensure their comfort. Veterinarians accompanied the convoy to monitor health and hydration, while forest guards ensured smooth passage along the highways.

“This is a proud moment for us each year,” said a senior forest officer. “These elephants are not just participants in the celebrations but also symbols of Karnataka’s cultural heritage. The public looks forward to their arrival as much as to the festivities themselves.”

Once settled, the jumbos will undergo a regimen of training and acclimatization. This includes familiarizing them with ceremonial music, processional crowds, and the ornate attire they will don during the festival. Nutritionists have also prepared a special diet rich in sugarcane, jaggery, and millet to maintain their strength for the grand procession.

The arrival of this batch means that all ten elephants selected for the 2025 Dasara will soon be assembled in Mysuru. The highlight of the festivities, the Jamboo Savari procession on Vijayadashami, will see one of the seasoned elephants carry the golden howdah with the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari, as thousands of devotees and tourists gather to witness the spectacle.

With the full team of elephants now in place, Mysuru is abuzz with anticipation, as the city prepares to welcome visitors from across the globe for a celebration that blends devotion, tradition, and grandeur.","Generate the content for a news article titled: Second batch of five Dasara jumbos to arrive this evening Do not search the web for content, the article should be completely original.",fake,1
"Second batch of five Dasara jumbos to arrive this evening.

The second batch of five Dasara elephants, including three debutants, will be welcomed into the Mysore Palace through Jayamarthanda Gate at 4 pm today on their arrival from forest camps.

The five elephants, which include three males and two females are: 43-year-old Gopi, 43-year-old Sugreeva and 11-year-old Hemavathi (debutant) from Dubare Elephant Camp, 56-year-old Srikanta (debutant) from Mathigodu Elephant Camp and 44-year-old Roopa (debutant) from Bheemanakatte Elephant Camp.

Elephant Bhima, which arrived in the first batch, topped the chart at 5,465 kg when its weight was checked on Aug. 11. But Srikanta, which will be participating for the first time in Dasara festivities this year, is heavier than Bhima and it is said that he is the strongest among other Dasara elephants. He is also tipped to become the Golden Howdah carrier in future.

It may be recalled that the first batch of nine Dasara elephants led by Captain and Golden Howdah carrier Abhimanyu arrived in city on Aug. 4 and entered Mysore Palace on Aug. 10. The nine Dasara elephants are now put on special diet. Training to make them familiar on Jumboo Savari route and get accustomed to the traffic has begun.

Yesterday, the nine Dasara jumbos underwent route familiarisation training in the presence of hundreds of people. When the jumbos, which were led out through Balarama Gate, adjacent to Kote Anjaneyaswamy Temple, hundreds of people clicked photos of their favourite elephant and also took videos of their march.

Yesterday being a Sunday, tourists had also arrived in large numbers and witnessed the elephants marching on Jumboo Savari route. As a marathon was also flagged off at the same time, the runners ran along the jumbos for some distance after which the Police and Forest Department personnel asked them to stay at a safe distance from the elephants.

The elephants marched till the Old RMC Circle and returned  to the Palace disappointing those who were waiting beyond Old RMC Circle as they had thought that the elephants would march till the Torchlight Parade Grounds in Bannimantap.

"City of Tyler expands 2025 Structure Flooding Project, adds streets.

TYLER, TX — The City of Tyler has announced an expansion of its 2025 Structure Flooding Project, adding five additional streets to its stormwater infrastructure improvement plan in an effort to mitigate chronic flooding in historically vulnerable neighborhoods.

During Tuesday’s city council meeting, officials unanimously approved the amended scope of the project, increasing the budget by $1.8 million to accommodate upgrades in East and South Tyler. Newly added areas include portions of Glenwood Boulevard, Bellwood Road, Old Henderson Highway, West Queen Street, and portions of Paluxy Drive.

“These additions are the result of resident feedback, updated hydrological modeling, and a commitment to ensuring no community is left behind when it comes to flood safety,” said City Engineer Laura McKinney.

The Structure Flooding Project, originally launched in early 2024, was designed to address over 40 residential properties that experienced repeated water intrusion during seasonal storms. With the expansion, that number is projected to rise to 58 affected properties receiving remediation.

Work Includes:

Enlarged storm drain culverts

Additional inlets and curb improvements

Soil regrading and enhanced runoff channels

Pavement elevation changes on low-lying stretches

The city has partnered with local engineering firm Ward & Associates to accelerate assessments on the new streets, with construction on the added segments scheduled to begin in late October. The entire project remains on track for completion by December 2025.

Residents in the newly added areas expressed cautious optimism.

“We’ve had ankle-deep water in our garage more than once,” said Lisa Robles, who lives on West Queen Street. “Knowing the city is finally taking it seriously means a lot.”

The city will host two open houses in August to provide detailed timelines and gather additional community input. Officials noted that while the expanded work may briefly disrupt traffic in affected zones, they’re committed to minimizing inconvenience.

“Stormwater doesn’t respect ZIP codes or property lines,” McKinney added. “Our job is to future-proof Tyler, one street at a time.”

"City of Tyler expands 2025 Structure Flooding Project, adds streets.

More Tyler homes will soon benefit from drainage improvements as the City of Tyler adds Kidd Drive and Downing Street to the 2025 Structure Flooding Project. Recurring flooding has impacted three homes and several nearby properties.  On Wednesday, the city council approved a Master Services Agreement for $42,300 with The C.T. Brannon Corporation for the design and construction phase services to Kidd Drive and Downing Street as part of the 2025 Structure Flooding Projects.  The city learned about stormwater issues in the area, and in 2018, a drainage study identified solutions to the problem. However, repairs were delayed due to challenges involving private property.

The city said it continued monitoring the area until flooding began affecting homes, not just yards.  In fiscal year 2024-2025, the city completed a preliminary engineering study to explore a cost-effective, less disruptive solution for the neighborhood. The study confirmed that adding a new stormwater inlet and secondary main alongside the existing system would resolve the issue without requiring any demolitions.  To move the project forward, Stormwater and Environmental Engineer Paul Neuhaus met with impacted residents to discuss easement needs and gain support for the project.

The original 2025 Structure Flooding Project, approved in June 2025 for $1.27 million, targets six areas prone to structural flooding:  Persimmon Drive Haverhill Drive and Old Henderson Highway Golden Road and Black Fork Creek Kensington Drive Ninth Street Princedale In those neighborhoods, crews will replace undersized pipes, add stormwater inlets, stabilize drainage channels and rebuild sidewalks, driveways and pavement as needed.  Adding Kidd Drive and Downing Street brings the total project to seven neighborhoods, with design, easement acquisition and construction scheduled in the coming months.

The 2025 Structure Flooding Project is funded through the Stormwater Capital Outlay Budget and Half Cent Sales Tax Fund. Construction will begin later this year and be phased to minimize disruptions for residents.

"City Issues Earthquake Fault Notice.

[City Name], [Date] — City officials have issued a formal Earthquake Fault Notice after new geological studies confirmed that several properties lie within close proximity to an active fault zone.
According to the Department of Building and Safety, the notice affects dozens of residential and commercial parcels that sit along mapped fault lines. Property owners will now be required to disclose the fault zone designation in real estate transactions and, in some cases, conduct additional seismic safety studies before new construction or major renovations.
City geologist Dr. Maria Lopez explained that the notice is a precautionary measure to increase awareness and preparedness. “The fault has been dormant for many years, but the potential for future seismic activity remains. Our goal is to ensure that residents and businesses are informed and that development in these areas is done responsibly,” she said.
The notice does not require immediate evacuation or demolition of existing structures, but it may affect property values and future development plans. Local officials emphasized that current buildings remain safe for occupancy, but encouraged homeowners to review earthquake insurance options and strengthen preparedness measures.
City Councilmember James Rivera, whose district includes several of the affected neighborhoods, called for calm and cooperation. “This is about transparency and safety. By identifying fault zones clearly, we can help protect lives and make sure future construction is resilient to earthquakes,” Rivera stated.
Residents with properties in the designated areas will receive official letters in the coming weeks. The city also announced that informational workshops will be held to explain the implications of the fault notice and provide guidance on retrofitting options.
The U.S. Geological Survey has noted that while no major earthquakes are imminent, California’s seismic history underscores the importance of proactive planning.

"Trump visit to CMU sparks student protests ahead of energy and AI summit.

Student activists at Carnegie Mellon University mobilized this week in opposition to President Donald Trump’s planned appearance at the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, set to begin on campus Tuesday. Demonstrators gathered at key campus entrances and on “The Fence,” CMU’s iconic free‑speech landmark, to voice dissent over both Trump’s administration policies and the university’s decision to host him.
The summit, co‑hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, aims to highlight advances in artificial intelligence and energy infrastructure, featuring panels on data center expansion and AI-driven sustainability. Its announcement in mid‑June prompted the launch of an online petition, which amassed over 1,000 signatures by July 3, led by a coalition of undergraduates and alumni calling on CMU to rescind Trump’s invitation.
Protesters sharply criticized Trump for his administration’s research‑funding cuts across federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, as well as restrictive visa policies affecting international students and reviews of campus diversity programs. Environmental concerns also fueled the demonstrations: students warned that aggressive data center construction would spur increased fracking and water usage in Pennsylvania, while rapid campus redevelopment risked driving up local housing costs and displacing lower‑income residents.
Tensions peaked Thursday evening when roughly 200 protesters marched toward Forbes Avenue, chanting slogans such as “Dump Trump” and “Shame on you, CMU,” before confronting a line of Pittsburgh police officers in riot gear. No arrests were reported, but organizers described the standoff as a stark symbol of campus frustration.
Despite the uproar, President Trump and Senator McCormick are scheduled to unveil a $90 billion private‑sector investment plan aimed at scaling data center development across the state and creating tens of thousands of jobs. CMU President Farnam Jahanian defended the university’s role in a July 1 campuswide memo, emphasizing CMU’s mission to convene diverse viewpoints on matters of national importance and noting past legal challenges the institution has mounted against federal policies it opposed.
As security measures tighten ahead of Tuesday’s program, students and faculty remain divided. Organizers of the “Stop the Summit” movement vow to continue peaceful protests throughout the event, insisting that free expression on campus must include the right to object to its highest‑profile guests.","Write a news article with the title ""Trump visit to CMU sparks student protests ahead of energy and AI summit"".",fake,1

Dave McCormick’s inaugural Energy and Innovation summit to be held Tuesday at the university where the Pennsylvania senator, alongside President Donald Trump and energy and AI leaders, are set to “showcase Pennsylvania’s incredible potential to power the AI revolution,” according to Mr. McCormick’s announcement.
It’s a proper opportunity for a protest, according to former Pittsburgh mayoral chief of staff Joe Mistick, who also teaches down the road from CMU at Duquesne University.
It’s clear that some of the community that calls the university home are frustrated by the decision to host the political figures.
Carnegie Mellon is an elite university situated in a city full of progressive leaders who have been pushing back on many of Trump’s plans. Mayor Ed Gainey has very publicly declared he will not work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and other elected officials have been protesting a move by UPMC, the city’s largest healthcare provider, to adhere to Trump’s demands to stop gender-affirming care for transgender youth. 
A rally and a protest march have already been scheduled for Tuesday at the same time the summit is occurring. Indivisible Pittsburgh — which has been hosting anti-Trump rallies for months and protesting outside Mr. McCormick’s local office — has organized the protest.
Nearly 1,500 people — some associated with the university and some living nearby — signed a petition urging Carnegie Mellon to reconsider its decision to host.
Days after the petition was presented to university leadership, President Farnam Jahanian released a letter saying that school officials viewed the opportunity to host the summit as “consequential to elevating and advancing both Carnegie Mellon’s mission and impact.”
“Our university has hosted leaders for discussions that explore issues of significant national and societal importance. Similarly, we have a history of constructively engaging with the federal government and administrations across the political spectrum,” the letter said.
But some think this may be a way for the university to acquiesce to Trump, who has been targeting higher education institutions since being sworn in.
CMU, too, has found itself in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s crackdown on colleges and universities. Like many others, CMU stands to lose millions of dollars in research funding amid sweeping cuts.
The university is also being investigated for its ties to alleged race-exclusionary practices, and has seen its high population of international students face increased scrutiny amid visa revocations and threats to Chinese student visas. More than 42% of the elite institution’s 15,600 students were foreign in fall 2023, with about half of those students being from China.
In March, Mr. Jahanian penned a lengthy letter responding to federal shake-ups and detailing CMU’s path forward. A month later, Carnegie Mellon was one of 350 universities to sign a letter criticizing government overreach and political interference in higher education.
But this event might prove beneficial to the university, as officials can show off to the president the work that is being accomplished with the research funding, according to Jon Fansmith, senior vice president of government relations and national engagement for the American Council on Education.
“I can understand that this is an administration that attracts controversy in a lot of ways — especially given their interactions with higher ed. There is healthy and reasonable criticism of this administration,” he said, “but certainly in terms of what Carnegie Mellon itself is doing — it would be good if we had more of these interactions between the administration where they could see the benefits of what colleges and universities are providing our society and take that away with them.”
Tuesday’s summit will likely be a who’s-who of the nation’s tech and energy industries.
Meanwhile, officials from the Pittsburgh International Airport and members of the county’s economic development staff are expected to attend some of the events, though an exact list of attendees has not been released.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, will attend the energy and artificial intelligence summit in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, the Post-Gazette has learned.
There will be some notable absences, though, like county Executive Sara Innamorato, a progressive Democrat who unseated a longtime establishment member of the state House before being elected. She has been sharply critical of Trump’s federal funding cuts, many of which impact various county services. 
Ms. Innamorato will be overseas during the event, according to her spokeswoman Abigail Gardner. Plus, the head of the county “has not been invited,” Ms. Gardner said.
Allegheny County was one of the few Pennsylvania counties that did not flip for Trump last year. Locally, the electorate has put progressives like U.S. Rep. Summer Lee, Ms. Innamorato and Mr. Gainey in office.
Others believe the event at CMU goes beyond politics.
“This is the future of our city, and they should be proud to host it,” Jason Richey, chair of the Republican Committee of Allegheny County, said.
Students and faculty should be allowed to object and protest peacefully, he added.
""But I hope that the attendees there, and I hope the city-at-large understands what a great event, what a seminal event that Dave McCormick has put together, and the opportunity here for Pittsburgh,"" Mr. Richey said.
Anthony Cacciato, a CMU student and president of the College Republicans, said it was ""disappointing"" that protesters couldn’t see “the grander picture and what this means for Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon.”
Presidential visits to college campuses aren’t abnormal, said Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. But Trump’s appearance garnering calls for cancellation is a sign of the times, he said.
“This is [an example] of allowing campuses to morph from places of research and discourse and dialogue into petty, partisan silos that has gotten them into such a mess in the first place,” Mr. Hess said.
Carrie McDonough, a chemistry professor at CMU, penned a letter to Mr. Jahanian asking him to move the summit off campus — not because of the politics of the event.
“I am fully supportive of CMU and all universities having a lot of different people come to campus, including people that I do not at all agree with … It's that Trump is a harmful person, and he makes people feel like they don't belong here,” she said.",https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2025/07/14/carnegie-mellon-trump-ai-summit/stories/202507110075,real,0
"We’re scared’: Restaurants seek more protection after burglaries.

We’re Scared’: Restaurants Seek More Protection After Burglaries

In recent months, a surge of burglaries targeting restaurants has left business owners and staff on edge. Across urban centers and small towns alike, eateries have become frequent targets for thieves seeking cash, electronics, and expensive liquor. The uptick in crime is prompting calls for enhanced security measures and stronger partnerships with law enforcement to protect these vital community hubs.

The Growing Threat

Restaurant owners describe break-ins occurring during late-night hours, often with perpetrators smashing windows or prying open doors to gain entry. “It’s devastating,” said Maria Lopez, owner of a family-run café in downtown Portland. “We’ve been here for 10 years, but now every morning I come in wondering if it happened again.”

Police reports indicate that in some cities, restaurant burglaries have doubled compared to previous years. Thieves are not just targeting cash registers; they’re also after high-end equipment, alcoholic beverages, and even digital payment terminals.

Financial and Emotional Toll

The financial impact of these crimes is significant. Repairing broken windows, replacing stolen equipment, and dealing with lost inventory can cost thousands of dollars per incident. “Insurance covers some of it, but there are still out-of-pocket expenses,” explained Jason Nguyen, who manages a popular Asian fusion restaurant. “Plus, you lose business during the time you’re trying to clean up and make repairs.”

Beyond the monetary loss, the psychological toll on staff and owners is equally damaging. Many report feeling anxious and unsafe, particularly those who work late shifts. “We’re scared,” said waitress Emily Harris. “Every noise at night makes us jumpy now.”

Calls for Action

In response, restaurant associations and business coalitions are advocating for:

Increased Police Patrols: Many business owners are urging local governments to allocate more resources for nighttime patrols in commercial areas.

Security Grants: Some municipalities have begun offering grants to help small businesses invest in security upgrades, such as surveillance cameras and reinforced doors.

Community Watch Programs: In neighborhoods where businesses band together to watch for suspicious activity, incidents of burglary have declined.

Investing in Protection

Many restaurant owners are taking matters into their own hands, investing in high-tech security systems. “We installed cameras that alert us in real time if someone tries to break in,” said David Kim, who owns a chain of pizzerias. Others have hired overnight security guards or fortified their premises with metal grilles and reinforced glass.

Striking a Balance

While security upgrades are necessary, some business owners worry about creating an unwelcoming atmosphere for customers. “We don’t want to turn our restaurant into a fortress,” said Sarah Patel, who co-owns a café known for its open and inviting ambiance. “But at the same time, we need to protect ourselves.”

The Way Forward

Experts emphasize the importance of community collaboration in tackling this issue. “When businesses, law enforcement, and residents work together, we see better outcomes,” said Detective James Parker. He recommends that restaurants document incidents thoroughly, share information, and remain proactive about security.

As restaurants continue to grapple with these challenges, their resilience and determination remain evident. For many owners, their businesses are more than just sources of income—they are cornerstones of their communities. Protecting these establishments is about safeguarding not just livelihoods, but the vibrant cultural fabric they represent.

"We’re scared’: Restaurants seek more protection after burglaries.

Jolted by a recent string of overnight burglaries, more than two dozen Palo Alto restaurant owners met with Police Department brass on Monday to get updates on the investigation, swap crime prevention tips and demand better public notification when crimes occur.

The meeting, which was organized by the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce, focused on five overnight restaurant burglaries that took place in the downtown area between Dec. 23 and Dec. 31. These included burglaries at Nola and Local Union 271 where intruders made off with restaurant safes; an incident at Coupa Café where burglars damaged doorways and broke the cashiers; and a burglary at an office operated by the restaurant Tamarind on the night of Dec. 27, according to police Capt. Zach Perron.

There was also an unsuccessful attempt to burglarize 02 Valley, a Taiwanese restaurant on University Avenue, according to Perron.

Perron outlined some of the actions that the police are taking to combat the trend, including increased foot patrols during nighttime and police cars stationed around various downtown locations. He also said that detectives have “promising leads” in their investigation, which he called “very good news.”

While Perron did not provide details about the leads, he suggested that the burglars who targeted Palo Alto may be the same people who committed similar crimes in other communities along the Peninsula and in East Bay communities such as Oakland and San Leandro.

“Once we arrest those responsible, I’d be surprised if the only crimes they have committed are limited to Palo Alto,” Perron said.

For many merchants, the problem was compounded by what they deemed to be inadequate public communication. Police did not publicize the string of burglaries, which only became public after social media posts from a member of the business community.

Nancy Coupal, owner of Coupa Café, said it’s important for police to notify businesses after these types of incidents so that they can take the necessary precautions.

“Nobody knew, and I think that is not a good idea. I think we all need to be informed immediately and for the community to be informed so that there is a lot of eyes looking,” Coupal said.

In her case, burglars broke into the Ramona Street café through the sky light and crawled on the floor to avoid triggering the alarm system. They also broke the cash registers and the doors leading into the café’s office, which did not contain a safe.

Perron advised the merchants and restaurant owners at the virtual meeting to make sure they have a functional and updated alarm system and, if possible, to include an audio monitoring.

“You can often tell if the conversation is surrounded by cleaning supplies or something like that, where we know we’re going into some housekeepers and janitorial folks and not burglaries,” Perron said. “If they’re saying the safe is up here, that’s as good clue for us that we got live bad guys inside the building then.”

He also urged business owners to limit the amount of cash that they have on site, to make sure that their safes are bolted down (even though this measure did not help Nola and Local Union 271), and to call the police if they or any of their employees see suspicious activity like people testing locked doors, looking inside closed businesses or carrying crowbars.

Perron called the string of overnight restaurant burglaries an “anomaly” and said that he does not remember at any point in his career seeing so many break-ins in such a short period of time.

“That doesn’t make it any less real for those of you who have bene victims and who are still dealing with the aftermath of putting your places back together,” Perron said.

Some restaurant owners have already takem action to protect themselves. Megan Kwakab, co-owner of the Patio, said her restaurant has adjusted to the recent burglaries by making it clear to any potential intruder that the restaurant has no money on site.

“We’re scared. We’re not leaving any money. We’re leaving our cash registers wide open,” Kwakab said.

While the meeting was largely focused on overnight restaurant burglaries, some attendees also urged the city to address homelessness and car break-ins in the downtown area. Manuel Martinez, owner of San Agus, said he has seen cases in which homeless individuals slapped customers who declined to give them money.

“What are we doing about that?” he asked. “The burglaries are very important, but safety for employees and patrons are also important.”

Perron said that the department has a two-person “special problems detail” that is charged with working with homeless individuals and ensuring that they know about available social services. Officers are also performing outreach to homeless individuals who stay in public garages, he said.

“The ones who unfortunately get cited, that’s done after they are provided all sorts of resources from us and offered alternatives,” Perron said. “The enforcement arm is the last resort but it’s a constant ongoing task, especially for our night shift and early day shift personnel.”

"Biden raises eyebrows for claiming he watched 2022 bridge collapse in Pittsburgh
'I got there and saw it collapse,' Biden tells Milwaukee crowd.

President Joe Biden sparked confusion and drew scrutiny during a speech in Milwaukee on Wednesday when he claimed he witnessed the 2022 bridge collapse in Pittsburgh firsthand.

""I was there. I got there and saw it collapse,"" Biden told the crowd while discussing infrastructure investments under his administration. The comment appeared to reference the collapse of the Fern Hollow Bridge in Pittsburgh’s Frick Park on January 28, 2022 — an incident that occurred just hours before Biden was scheduled to visit the city to promote his infrastructure agenda.

However, according to official timelines and media reports at the time, the President arrived in Pittsburgh after the bridge had already collapsed and was briefed on the scene later in the day. Photographs and press coverage show him touring the wreckage, but not witnessing the collapse in real time.

The comment quickly gained traction online, with critics questioning the accuracy of the President’s recollection. Some conservative commentators accused Biden of embellishing the moment for dramatic effect, while supporters argued he may have been speaking figuratively or misspoke.

The White House has not yet issued a clarification regarding the statement.

The Fern Hollow Bridge collapse injured ten people and prompted an urgent review of infrastructure safety in the state. Biden later referenced the incident to underscore the need for investment in aging bridges and roads, tying it directly to the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill passed in 2021.","Generate a news piece that is close to a real report based on the title below：Biden raises eyebrows for claiming he watched 2022 bridge collapse in Pittsburgh 'I got there and saw it collapse,' Biden tells Milwaukee crowd",fake,1
"Biden raises eyebrows for claiming he watched 2022 bridge collapse in Pittsburgh
'I got there and saw it collapse,' Biden tells Milwaukee crowd.

In 2020, Biden had to walk back repeated claims that he was arrested in apartheid-era South Africa while trying to visit Nelson Mandela.

In 2019, Biden told a crowd of college students a harrowing story about a Navy captain in Afghanistan that was later debunked by the Washington Post.

In 2013, Biden said he heard the gunshots of an Amish schoolhouse shooting that killed five students while playing golf nearby in Pennsylvania in 2006. The Washington Times poured cold water on the claim at the time, reporting that no golf course in the area had any record of hosting Biden.

In 2008, Biden said his helicopter in Afghanistan was ""forced down"" by al Qaeda insurgents on ""the superhighway of terror."" The Associated Press later reported that a snowstorm, not the enemy, forced the pilot to land.

In 2007, Biden said he had been ""shot at"" during a trip years earlier to Iraq. He later clarified that he was ""near where a shot landed.""

Biden’s tall-tale telling came to light during his first presidential campaign in 1988, from which he eventually withdrew under the weight of multiple plagiarism allegations. During that campaign, he also falsely claimed that he attended law school on a full scholarship and graduated in the top half of his class, which he later admitted was untrue. He also said at the time that he ""marched with tens of thousands"" of people during the civil rights movement, but that also turned out to be false.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-raises-eyebrows-claiming-he-watched-2022-bridge-collapse-pittsburgh,real,0

"UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital nurses vote for unionization.

Registered nurses at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital have voted in favor of representation by SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania, capping off a decades-long drive by the union to organize a health system flagship hospital in Oakland, the union said Sunday.

The vote for union representation was 402 to 305 after balloting on Aug. 19 and 23. The votes were counted Saturday, according to SEIU.

“My coworkers and I are absolutely overjoyed to finally win a union voice for our patients, our profession and our community,” eight-year UPMC veteran and oncology nurse Jenna Berry said in a prepared statement. “We were incredibly inspired and thankful for the overwhelming support from our community, patients and elected officials.”

In a statement, UPMC said it looked forward to partnering with SEIU.

“We respect the decision of UPMC Magee nurses to unionize with the SEIU and look forward to a respectful partnership,” spokesman Paul Wood said. “We remain committed to fostering a collaborative work environment focused on providing exceptional care for our patients.”

Ashley Grieco, an advanced practice nurse in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit, in a prepared statement said unionization was the path forward to improve health care.

“The health care system in our state and our country has been heading in the wrong direction and that’s why doctors, nurses, advanced practitioners and other health care workers are standing up for ourselves and those we care for,” she said in a prepared statement.

The unionization of nurses at the hospital marks the culmination of a yearslong drive by the SEIU, which claimed the Pittsburgh-based health system has tried to thwart such efforts. 

SEIU petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to represent about 1,000 registered nurses and another 100 advanced practice registered nurses, all of whom work at the same hospital. A unionization vote by the advanced practice nurses unit is scheduled Sept. 6 and Sept. 9.

When the NLRB authorized the unionization vote earlier this year, the SEIU claimed claims it would mark the biggest union election in Pennsylvania in recent history. Supporters of the effort have included U.S. Rep. Summer Lee, Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato, city Mayor Ed Gainey and state Rep. Dan Frankel of Squirrel Hill.

Magee-Womens nurses plan a celebration rally Tuesday afternoon at Zelema Parklet, which is at the intersection of the Boulevard of the Allies and Zelema Street, near the hospital.

"UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital nurses vote for unionization.

Pittsburgh, PA – In a historic decision for healthcare workers in Western Pennsylvania, nurses at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital voted overwhelmingly to unionize, with a final tally of 402 to 305. The nurses will now join Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Healthcare Pennsylvania, marking the largest nurse union election in the state's recent history.

The vote, which was counted late Saturday, follows a lengthy and at times contentious campaign. Nurses cited concerns over unsafe staffing levels, burnout, and inadequate working conditions as primary motivations for seeking union representation. Registered Nurse Jenna Berry expressed the sentiment of many colleagues, stating, ""My co-workers and I are absolutely overjoyed to finally win a union voice for our patients, our profession and our community.""

UPMC, which had previously campaigned against the unionization effort, released a statement acknowledging the results.

""We remain committed to fostering a collaborative work environment focused on providing exceptional care for our patients.""

Elected officials and community leaders celebrated the vote, urging UPMC to begin contract negotiations promptly. U.S. Congresswoman Summer Lee congratulated the nurses and called on UPMC to accept the decision without delay.

"EaseMyTrip co-founder Prashant Pitti vows to cut Bengaluru traffic by 30% in one year.

Bengaluru, July 24, 2025 — In a bold and unprecedented move, EaseMyTrip co-founder Prashant Pitti has announced a transformative initiative aimed at reducing Bengaluru’s notorious traffic congestion by 30% within the next 12 months. The declaration, made during a packed press conference at the Bengaluru Tech Summit, has sent ripples across the city and sparked cautious optimism among citizens long frustrated by the city’s chronic gridlock.

""This is not just a promise — it’s a mission,"" said Pitti, addressing a gathering of policymakers, entrepreneurs, urban planners, and journalists. “Bengaluru is the beating heart of India’s innovation economy, but our traffic problem is choking its potential. We can’t wait for the future to fix this — we must fix it now.”

A Public-Private Collaboration
According to Pitti, the plan — dubbed ""Mission 30: Bengaluru Unblocked"" — will be a public-private partnership involving the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Bengaluru Traffic Police, and a coalition of tech startups, logistics platforms, and AI researchers. EaseMyTrip, primarily known as a travel-tech firm, will anchor the initiative with an initial commitment of ₹200 crore in seed funding.

The strategy will blend cutting-edge technology with urban design and behavioral nudges. Key features include:

AI-Powered Dynamic Routing: Collaborating with navigation apps and transport aggregators to implement real-time traffic rebalancing and smart detours.

Decentralized Work Zones: Encouraging corporates to adopt distributed co-working pods across the city, reducing long daily commutes.

Green Mobility Credits: Launch of a blockchain-based rewards platform for citizens who carpool, cycle, or use public transport.

AI-Driven Traffic Signals: Partnering with IIIT-Bangalore to deploy adaptive traffic lights that respond to vehicle density in real-time.

Logistics Decongestion: Creating dedicated “delivery windows” for e-commerce fleets to reduce daytime bottlenecks.

A City at a Crossroads
Bengaluru, often dubbed the Silicon Valley of India, has been ranked among the world’s most traffic-congested cities for several years running. According to TomTom’s 2024 Traffic Index, drivers in the city spend an average of 243 hours a year stuck in traffic — equivalent to over 10 days lost annually.

Pitti emphasized that inaction was no longer an option. “If we want to be a global city, we have to start solving problems at scale. This isn’t just about traffic — it’s about productivity, mental health, environmental sustainability, and the quality of life for every Bengalurean.”

Support and Skepticism
The announcement has been met with a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism.

Dr. Rajendra Babu, Chief Urban Planner at BBMP, welcomed the initiative: “We’ve been waiting for a disruptor to shake things up. If executed well, this could be a landmark in Bengaluru’s urban evolution.”

However, citizens have expressed measured hope. “We’ve heard many promises before,” said Aditi Menon, a tech worker who commutes from Whitefield to Koramangala. “But if someone like Pitti can mobilize the private sector, maybe there’s a real shot.”

Former Bengaluru Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao also weighed in: “Technology can help, but enforcement, policy alignment, and citizen discipline are equally vital. I hope this initiative doesn’t underestimate that.”

Monthly Progress Reports
In a move signaling transparency and accountability, the Mission 30 team has committed to publishing monthly traffic data dashboards and hosting open town halls for public feedback.

""We will not vanish after the announcement,"" Pitti assured. ""This is a battle for Bengaluru’s future — and we’re in it, every step of the way.""

A Turning Point?
With over 1.2 crore citizens watching closely, and with support from both civic authorities and the startup community, the coming months could mark a turning point in Bengaluru’s long struggle with its roads.

For now, the city holds its breath — cautiously hopeful that a tech entrepreneur might succeed where bureaucracy and urban fatigue have often fallen short.

"EaseMyTrip co-founder Prashant Pitti vows to cut Bengaluru traffic by 30% in one year.

EaseMyTrip Co-founder Prashant Pitti Thursday announced a collaborative initiative aimed at reducing traffic congestion in Bengaluru by 25-30 per cent within a year.

The plan, which brings together public institutions, private firms, and scientific minds on a common platform, was initiated following a series of high-level meetings over the past 10 days with key stakeholders, including Bengaluru traffic police, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), city police, Google India, IISc researchers, and mobility entrepreneurs.

On social media platform X, Pitti described the collaboration as unprecedented, where for the first time all key public and private players will be working together. The initiative will rely heavily on data science, AI-driven simulations, and community involvement to enable real-time interventions and long-term systemic fixes.

Among the immediate steps outlined, Pitti is exploring traffic simulation models with IISc and the traffic police’s already established rerouting simulation tools that prioritise time over distance. Pitti has also approached Google, Uber, Ola, and Rapido to share anonymised data to strengthen predictive models. “Once operational, these could anticipate and prevent gridlocks before they happen,” he said.

Pitti has offered to take charge of an existing government grievance redressal app, expanding its scope beyond potholes to cover illegal parking, broken signals, waterlogging, and more. He said he was aiming to promote transparency by publicly showcasing complaints and resolution timelines. To prevent delays in road work due to unexpected rain, Pitti has also proposed a real-time weather predictor that will proactively address drainage-related disruptions.

The approach signals a shift from infrastructure dependence to optimisation of existing systems using technology, intent, and data. “If we continue to wait for infrastructure upgrades, we are merely playing catch-up,” Pitti said, emphasising that practical optimism and collaboration can solve what appears unfixable.

Pitti has also launched a WhatsApp community to crowdsource feedback from daily commuters on trouble zones. He appealed to the public to contribute by identifying junctions with major congestion issues, helping the project pinpoint focus areas.

This fresh announcement builds on an earlier offer made by Pitti on July 14, where he committed Rs 1 crore to fund a project aimed at identifying and solving choke points across Bengaluru using Google Maps’ Road Management Insight, launched recently for city-level traffic analytics.

The budget was proposed for hiring senior Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence engineers, procuring Graphics Processing Unit resources and satellite imagery, funding Application Programming Interface calls, data storage, and creating detailed, time-based maps of chronic congestion zones.",https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/easemytrip-co-founder-prashant-pitti-vows-to-cut-bengaluru-traffic-10147144/,real,0
"What trapped Zhao Lusi?.

Chinese actress Zhao Lusi, known for her bright on-screen presence and romantic comedy roles, has recently become the subject of heated discussion online. Fans and media alike are asking: what trapped Zhao Lusi?

The question, circulating as a trending hashtag on Weibo this week, doesn’t refer to a literal accident but rather to the paradox of her stardom. Zhao’s rapid rise over the past five years—from breakout performances in “Oh! My Emperor” to leading roles in big-budget dramas—has elevated her to one of the most recognizable faces in Chinese television. Yet that success has also boxed her into a narrow public image.

Critics argue that she is “trapped” by typecasting, with producers repeatedly casting her as the same lively, sweet heroine that first won her a fanbase. Industry watchers note that while this consistency guarantees popularity, it may also limit her artistic growth and ability to take on more challenging or diverse roles.

On the other hand, some fans suggest the real trap lies in public scrutiny. Zhao has faced intense online monitoring of her personal life, fashion choices, and even her offhand remarks. Each drama release triggers not only ratings battles but also waves of social media speculation, where praise and criticism mix in equal measure.

Entertainment analysts point out that Zhao Lusi’s situation is not unique—many young stars find themselves balancing between audience expectations and professional ambition. Still, the framing of “what trapped Zhao Lusi?” has sparked a wider cultural conversation about how China’s entertainment industry cultivates idols and how difficult it can be for them to reinvent themselves once audiences fix them in place.

For Zhao, the answer may not be what trapped her, but rather how she will choose to break free.","generate a news article with the title ""What trapped Zhao Lusi?""",fake,1
"What trapped Zhao Lusi?.

Clicking on Zhao Lusi's Weibo now displays ""This account has been closed due to user voluntary request and is now unavailable.""

This was a pre-announced departure. Zhao Lusi had already announced it during her livestream, and after officially completing the deregistration process, she immediately shared her farewell message: ""I'm so happy.

"TSMC’s Chiayi Science Park construction site suffers four major safety accidents in two months, resulting in two deaths, and is ordered to halt work..

Chiayi, Taiwan – July 23, 2025 — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s leading semiconductor foundry, has come under scrutiny after four serious safety incidents occurred at its construction site in Chiayi Science Park over the past two months. The accidents have tragically claimed the lives of two workers and injured several others, prompting government regulators to issue an immediate suspension of all construction activities at the site.

The Ministry of Labor announced the halt order late Tuesday following an on-site inspection. The ministry cited repeated violations of workplace safety regulations and inadequate response measures as the primary reasons for the stop-work directive. Officials noted that the frequency and severity of the incidents raised grave concerns over contractor oversight, worker training, and enforcement of safety protocols.

TSMC confirmed the suspension in a statement issued Wednesday morning and expressed condolences to the victims’ families. “We deeply regret the tragic loss of life and are fully cooperating with authorities to investigate the cause of the accidents,” the statement read. “Ensuring the safety of our workers is our top priority, and we are committed to implementing immediate corrective actions.”

Details of the accidents have not all been disclosed, but reports indicate that they include scaffolding collapses, equipment malfunctions, and a fall from height. All incidents are believed to have occurred during the facility’s ongoing Phase I construction, which began earlier this year and was slated to be completed by late 2026.

Local labor unions and safety advocates have called for a broader audit of construction projects within the rapidly expanding Chiayi Science Park. “The pace of development cannot come at the expense of human lives,” said Lin Yung-chih, a spokesperson for Taiwan’s Construction Safety Alliance. “These incidents reflect systemic problems that go beyond one site or one company.”

The halt order is expected to delay the overall timeline of the Chiayi fab project, a key part of TSMC’s expansion strategy aimed at strengthening Taiwan’s domestic chip manufacturing capacity. While the company has not yet released a revised schedule, analysts warn the delay could have ripple effects on supply chain planning for several global customers.

This incident marks the most serious safety lapse at a TSMC construction site in recent years and highlights the growing tension between industrial growth and workplace safety enforcement in Taiwan’s booming tech sector.

Regulators say construction will remain suspended until all safety deficiencies are corrected and compliance is verified through re-inspection.","generate a news article in based on the title TSMC’s Chiayi Science Park construction site suffers four major safety accidents in two months, resulting in two deaths, and is ordered to halt work.",fake,1
"TSMC’s Chiayi Science Park construction site suffers four major safety accidents in two months, resulting in two deaths, and is ordered to halt work..

IT Home, July 20 — According to Taiwanese media outlets Liberty Times and Industrial and Commercial Times, a major construction site at TSMC's facility in the Chiayi Science Park experienced a trailer overturning accident today. The vehicle involved was reportedly carrying around 50 tons at the time. No casualties have been reported so far.

TSMC is currently undertaking multiple infrastructure projects in the Chiayi Science Park. Right next to the site of the incident is the under-construction AP7 CoWoS advanced packaging plant. AP7 has also seen three serious industrial safety accidents in the past two months, resulting in a total of two deaths:

On May 20, a worker fell from a four-story scaffold and was left paralyzed.

On May 26, a transformer slipped during transport, leading to fatal injuries for the crane signalman.

Most recently, on Wednesday, July 16, a worker died after a chilled water pipeline fell due to a failed fixture during installation.

Due to the recent string of four major accidents in a short period, the Taiwanese Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has ordered a full suspension of all electromechanical engineering work by TSMC in the Chiayi Science Park.",https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20250720A08ITX00,real,0
"Badly needed' crosswalk completed on Newmarket's busy Gorham Street.

NEWMARKET, ONT. — After years of concerns from residents and local officials about pedestrian safety, a long-awaited crosswalk has been installed on Gorham Street, one of Newmarket’s busiest and most challenging thoroughfares.

The new crossing, located near Alexander Road, was officially completed this week and is already being praised by residents who say it fills a glaring gap in pedestrian infrastructure. For years, walkers along Gorham faced a choice between darting across multiple lanes of traffic or taking long detours to the nearest lights.

“This was badly needed,” said longtime resident Anne Douglas, who walks her grandchildren to school in the area. “Drivers fly down this street, and without a safe place to cross, it felt like you were risking your life every time.”

Years of advocacy

Local councillor Victor Woodhouse, who represents the ward, said the project was years in the making. “We’ve heard consistent feedback from residents about Gorham being unsafe, particularly for seniors and families,” he said. “This crosswalk has been on our radar for a long time, but getting it designed, funded, and coordinated with regional traffic engineers took patience.”

The crosswalk includes overhead flashing lights, high-visibility paint, and curb bump-outs to shorten the crossing distance. It was designed to slow traffic and make pedestrians more visible to drivers.

A growing safety concern

Gorham Street carries thousands of vehicles daily, serving as a key east–west artery connecting Leslie Street to Main Street. The mix of residential neighborhoods, schools, and nearby small businesses means heavy foot traffic is common, especially during morning and afternoon rush hours.

According to town staff, traffic studies conducted over the past three years showed above-average vehicle speeds along this stretch and a rising number of “near-miss” incidents reported by residents. “The data confirmed what the community had been saying — that this corridor was unsafe without intervention,” said Newmarket’s Director of Public Works, Susan Chase.

Looking ahead

The crosswalk is part of a broader town strategy to improve walkability and safety. Earlier this summer, Newmarket approved a “Vision Zero” framework aimed at eliminating serious injuries and fatalities on local roads. Gorham Street’s upgrade was identified as a priority under that plan.

Mayor John Taylor said the project reflects a shift in how the town views road design. “For too long, streets like Gorham were built to move cars as quickly as possible. Our responsibility now is to balance that with the safety of the people who live here,” he said. “This crosswalk is one small but important step toward that goal.”

Residents react

Early reactions from pedestrians suggest the effort is paying off. “I used it yesterday for the first time, and cars actually stopped right away,” said high school student Mark Villanueva. “That never happened before.”

Still, some residents caution that enforcement and education will be key. “Just painting lines on the road isn’t enough,” said nearby homeowner Kevin Wright. “We need drivers to respect it, and that will take time.”

For now, however, the new crosswalk is being celebrated as a victory for community persistence. “It’s been a long fight,” Douglas said, “but finally, we can walk across Gorham without holding our breath.”",generate a complete news article with the title: 'Badly needed' crosswalk completed on Newmarket's busy Gorham Street,fake,1
"Badly needed' crosswalk completed on Newmarket's busy Gorham Street.

The Town of Newmarket has completed a new signalized crosswalk at Gorham Street and Muriel Street, just in time for back-to-school season. 

The long-awaited pedestrian crossover has been under construction for several weeks and is now complete. Pedestrians can push a button to activate the signal, requiring vehicles to stop at designated yield lines set well back from the crossing. The crosswalk is located at a common crossing point for students attending Prince Charles Public School.

Resident Doug Mossop, who lives next to the intersection, has expressed safety concerns for the crossing for several years. He said it is great to have it in place.

“It’s badly needed for the seniors, the kids,” he said, adding there are thousands of vehicles crossing the road every day. “We’ve got a growing community, we have a lot more kids. Badly needed.”

The town approved plans for the crosswalk upgrade in 2024, with an initial estimated cost of $36,000. This came after a report found more than 5,700 cars went through the intersection in an eight-hour period in May 2023, warranting more work at the intersection. 

The town advises pedestrians and cyclists to make eye contact with drivers before crossing when it is safe to do so. The town added drivers must wait for pedestrians to fully cross before proceeding. Drivers failing to stop can face fines of up to $1,000 and four demerit points.

The area also has speed cameras, installed last year as part of the town’s automated speed enforcement program.

Mossop said some drivers seem confused about the new crossover, how it works and where they are supposed to stop.

“I don’t think people are familiar with the new design,” Mossop said.

Still, with signage in place to highlight the new traffic device, Mossop said he hopes drivers will respect it when school starts again next week.

“My hopes are that people stop and recognize there’s something in place. People drive through every day, but you know what, with distracted driving and everything, I don’t think they always notice the change,” he said.",https://www.newmarkettoday.ca/local-news/badly-needed-crosswalk-completed-on-newmarkets-busy-gorham-street-11127587,real,0
"Cyber Trap: 4.5k Indoreans Lose ₹40 Crore To Online Scams In 6 Months.

Indore, July 24, 2025 — In a shocking revelation, over 4,500 residents of Indore have collectively lost ₹40 crore to online scams in the past six months, highlighting the alarming rise of cyber fraud in the city.

According to the Indore Cyber Cell, most of these scams involved fake investment schemes, phishing links, digital payment frauds, and job offer scams. Fraudsters exploited social media platforms, messaging apps, and even cloned websites of reputed companies to lure unsuspecting victims.

“We’ve observed a 300% surge in digital fraud cases compared to the same period last year,” said Superintendent of Police (Cyber) Priya Sharma. “Many people are tempted by promises of quick money through online trading or fake work-from-home opportunities. By the time they realize it’s a scam, the money is gone.”

How the Scams Work
Fake Trading Apps: Victims were promised high returns on cryptocurrency or stock market investments but lost money after depositing funds in fraudulent apps.

Phishing & OTP Frauds: Scammers tricked victims into sharing OTPs, leading to unauthorized bank withdrawals.

Job & Loan Scams: Fraudsters charged “registration fees” for fake jobs or processing fees for non-existent loans.

Romance & Lottery Scams: Some victims were emotionally manipulated through dating apps or told they had “won a lottery” that required an advance fee.

Who Are the Victims?
While elderly citizens and homemakers formed a large chunk of the victims, even tech-savvy young professionals and students fell prey. Cyber experts say fraudsters use psychological manipulation and urgency tactics to bypass rational thinking.

Action by Authorities
The Indore Cyber Cell has frozen over 120 bank accounts linked to these scams and is working with national agencies to trace the masterminds. Officials have also launched an awareness drive in schools, colleges, and housing societies to educate citizens about online safety.","Cyber Trap: 4.5k Indoreans Lose ₹40 Crore To Online Scams In 6 Months

Indore (Madhya Pradesh): City Loses ₹40 Crore To Cyber Cons In Six Months. Despite repeated awareness campaigns by the police and cyber cell, cyber fraudsters continue to outsmart citizens, duping over 4,500 people across the city and stealing nearly ₹40 crore in the past six months alone.

Fraudsters have used an array of tricks to trap their victims—posing as CBI or police officials, holding people in digital arrest for days, and manipulating them through fake job offers, investment apps, loan schemes, and social media cons.

Reports show that in 2024, around ₹80 crore was swindled from approximately 5,000 victims. Shockingly, the number of complaints filed this year has already nearly matched last year’s total—yet we are only halfway through the year.

However, there is one silver lining: Additional DCP (Crime) Rajesh Dandotiya told Free Press that the recovery rate has improved. “Last year, ₹5.80 crore was recovered. This year, in just six months, we’ve already recovered ₹6.33 crore from fraudsters,” he said.",https://www.freepressjournal.in/indore/cyber-trap-45k-indoreans-lose-40-crore-to-online-scams-in-6-months,real,0

"Bihar Politics: JDU accuses RJD of insulting Karpoori Thakur, calls Lalu Yadav 'prisoner number 3351'.

# Bihar Politics: JDU accuses RJD of insulting Karpoori Thakur, calls Lalu Yadav 'prisoner number 3351'

**Patna, [Date]** - Political tensions in Bihar escalated sharply today as the Janata Dal (United) launched a scathing attack on the Rashtriya Janata Dal, accusing the opposition party of disrespecting the legacy of former Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur.

## JDU Leadership Condemns RJD Remarks

Senior JDU leaders held a press conference in Patna, where party spokesperson condemned what they termed as ""deliberate attempts"" by RJD leaders to undermine Karpoori Thakur's contributions to Bihar's socio-political landscape. Karpoori Thakur, who served as Bihar's Chief Minister twice and was known for his progressive policies on social justice, remains a revered figure across party lines.

""The RJD's recent statements about Karpoori ji are not just politically motivated but show their complete disregard for a leader who fought tirelessly for the backward classes,"" said a senior JDU functionary during the press briefing.

## Reference to Lalu's Imprisonment

In a particularly sharp retort, JDU leaders referred to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav as ""prisoner number 3351,"" alluding to his conviction in the fodder scam cases. This reference was made to highlight what the JDU termed as the ""moral bankruptcy"" of the RJD leadership.

The JDU spokesperson stated, ""Those who have no moral authority to speak, having spent years behind bars for corruption, should refrain from commenting on stalwarts like Karpoori Thakur.""

## Political Context

The war of words comes amid ongoing political realignments in Bihar, where both parties are positioning themselves ahead of future electoral battles. Karpoori Thakur's legacy remains significant in Bihar politics, particularly his role in implementing reservation policies for backward classes during his tenure in the 1970s.

## RJD's Response Awaited

As of press time, the RJD had not issued an official response to the JDU's allegations. However, party sources indicated that a detailed rebuttal was being prepared.

## Historical Significance

Karpoori Thakur, often referred to as ""Jan Nayak"" (People's Leader), was instrumental in implementing social justice policies in Bihar. His contributions to backward class empowerment continue to influence Bihar's political discourse decades after his death in 1988.

The current controversy highlights the ongoing struggle between Bihar's major political parties to claim the legacy of prominent historical figures for contemporary political advantage.

## Political Implications

Political analysts suggest that this exchange reflects the deeper ideological and personal rivalries that continue to shape Bihar's political landscape. The reference to Lalu Yadav's imprisonment particularly underscores the JDU's strategy to highlight corruption allegations against its opponents.

The incident also demonstrates how historical figures and their legacies remain central to political narratives in Bihar, with parties continuously attempting to position themselves as the true inheritors of various leaders' ideologies.

"Video captures victim knocked down in violent jewelry distraction theft in Richmond Hill: police.

Richmond Hill, ON — York Regional Police are appealing for witnesses and releasing video evidence after a violent distraction theft left a man injured and robbed of valuable jewelry in Richmond Hill.

According to investigators, the incident took place last week in a residential neighborhood near Bayview Avenue and Major Mackenzie Drive. Surveillance footage shows a vehicle pulling up beside the victim, a man in his 60s, before a woman exits and approaches him under the guise of offering a gift.

Moments later, the suspect can be seen forcefully grabbing the victim’s necklace, knocking him to the ground in the process. She then quickly returns to the waiting vehicle, which sped away from the scene.

“This was a brazen daytime theft that left the victim shaken and injured,” said Const. Mark Hayward of York Regional Police. “The suspects targeted him deliberately and used distraction and violence to carry out the crime. We are committed to identifying those responsible.”

Witness Accounts

Neighbors in the area told reporters they were stunned by the incident.

“I saw the man on the ground and rushed over,” said Farah Ali, who lives nearby. “He was clearly in pain and very upset. It’s frightening that something like this could happen in such a quiet neighborhood.”

Another resident, who asked not to be named, said similar thefts have been reported in nearby communities. “They come in cars, approach people who look like they’re wearing expensive jewelry, and then grab it. It’s happening more often than people realize.”

Police Investigation

Police say the suspects are believed to be part of a group responsible for a series of distraction thefts across the Greater Toronto Area. In many cases, suspects approach victims with fake jewelry or trinkets, pretending to offer them as gifts before snatching valuable necklaces, rings, or watches.

Authorities are urging the public to remain vigilant, particularly seniors and vulnerable individuals, who are often targeted.

“Do not accept unsolicited gifts from strangers, and if approached, maintain distance and call police if you feel threatened,” Const. Hayward added.

Call for Information

Investigators are asking anyone with information or additional video footage from the area to contact York Regional Police’s District Criminal Investigations Bureau. Anonymous tips can also be submitted to Crime Stoppers.

“This victim was left injured and traumatized. We need the community’s help to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” police said in a statement.","Write a detailed news article based on the title: Video captures victim knocked down in violent jewelry distraction theft in Richmond Hill: police.

"Video captures victim knocked down in violent jewelry distraction theft in Richmond Hill: police.

A man has been charged and police are looking for two other individuals allegedly involved in a violent distraction robbery last month in Richmond Hill. 

York Regional Police say the man charged is believed to be part of a criminal network of foreign nationals operating in the region. 

Police said in a news release Friday that they responded to a collision in a plaza parking lot near Yonge Street and Canyon Hill Avenue around 11:15 a.m. on July 15. That's where officers found a 78-year-old woman who had been violently robbed of jewelry.


A 35-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday, Const. James Dickson said.

Police released video footage of the incident Friday as they continue to search for two suspects, a man and a woman, also believed to be in the car at the time of the robbery. 

Dickson said the woman was left with serious but non-life threatening injuries.

""They were trying to steal her gold bracelet and ended up hitting her with the car, knocking her down,"" he said.

Police say the suspect fled the scene in a rental white 2024 Nissan Rogue before police arrived. Dickson said police have since recovered and returned that car.

'Very concerning'
Dickson said police are seeing cases of people coming to Canada for the ""explicit purpose of committing criminal offences.""

""This is something that's very concerning for us,"" he said.

""There's no one specific nationality that is involved in this kind of a theft,"" said Dickson.

In this case, police are still working to determine how long the group may have been active.


Dickson said sometimes suspects don't stay in the country for very long with the goods they're stealing.

""It's something that oftentimes they can get away with,"" he said.

But he says this is by no means the only criminal network that focuses on distraction style thefts.

The number of distraction style thefts tends to go up in warm weather, Dickson said. It's important to be cautious if people are coming up and asking for directions, wanting to show them jewelry or luring them to properties or parking lots to have conversations, he added.

Dickson says police have also seen a rise in violent robberies this year.

""Whether people are being shoved, whether it's a level of aggression to steal these items or in this case where someone's actually struck by a vehicle,"" he said.

Nanded: Cloudburst-like rain lashed the city and adjoining talukas through the night, flooding low-lying colonies and triggering house collapses that left 11 people dead, officials said on Tuesday. Continuous downpours turned lanes into streams, stranded commuters, and knocked out power in several pockets.

Rising water from the Godavari and local nullahs spilled into residential areas around Deglur Naka, Vazirabad, and Bhaskar Nagar. The railway underpass and stretches near the bus stand were knee- to waist-deep by dawn, forcing police to divert traffic and shut a few internal roads until the water receded.

Fire brigade teams, SDRF personnel, and municipal workers conducted rescues in inflatable boats, moving seniors and children from ground floors to nearby schools and community halls. Volunteers supplied tea, biscuits, and blankets as the administration converted classrooms into temporary shelters.

Hospitals reported multiple cases of injuries from wall collapses and electrocution. Power utilities began phased restoration to avoid short circuits, prioritizing medical facilities, water pumping stations, and relief camps. The civic body asked residents to switch off mains electricity if water had entered their homes and to avoid walking through moving water.

Schools and colleges were ordered shut for the day, with scheduled examinations postponed. Inter-district buses were delayed, and auto-rickshaw services were sporadic in waterlogged zones. Public works teams started clearing treefall and silt, but said some bridges and culverts would reopen only after structural checks.

Meteorological officials described the event as “cloudburst-like,” with a slow-moving cell dumping intense rain over the urban core and neighboring villages. An orange alert remains in place as more intermittent showers are possible; any fresh burst over saturated ground could cause quick runoff and renewed flooding.

Residents searching for missing family members were directed to help desks at the civil hospital and the collectorate, where lists of rescued persons and admissions are being updated. The district administration said ex-gratia assistance for the deceased will be processed after panchnamas and damage assessments are completed, and urged citizens to rely on official channels for updates on road closures and relief distribution.","make news article with this title- Nanded Rain Havoc : नांदेडात पाऊस ठरतोय काळ! ढगफुटी सदृश्य पावसाचा कहर, चहूकडे हाहाकार; ११ जणांचा अंत",fake,1
"School van overturns on railway track in Virudhachalam, eight students injured.

Virudhachalam, India – Eight students were injured this morning when a school van overturned on a railway track near Virudhachalam, a town in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu. The incident occurred around 8:30 AM IST as the van was transporting students to school.

According to preliminary reports, the driver of the school van attempted to cross an unmanned railway crossing when the vehicle stalled on the tracks. Despite efforts to restart the van, a train rapidly approached, forcing the driver and students to evacuate. The train subsequently collided with the van, causing it to overturn.

""We heard a loud screech and then a crash,"" said a local resident who witnessed the incident. ""It was terrifying to see the school van on the tracks with the train coming.""

Emergency services were immediately dispatched to the scene. The injured students were quickly transported to the nearby Virudhachalam Government Hospital for treatment. Authorities have stated that the injuries are mostly minor, consisting of cuts, bruises, and a few fractures, and all students are reported to be in stable condition.

The accident caused significant disruption to railway traffic on the Virudhachalam-Cuddalore section. Several trains were delayed as rescue operations and track clearance were underway.

Local police have launched an investigation into the incident, focusing on the cause of the van stalling on the tracks and the safety protocols surrounding the unmanned railway crossing. The driver of the van is currently being questioned.

"School van overturns on railway track in Virudhachalam, eight students injured.

About eight students were injured on Monday when a school van overturned while crossing a railway track at Poovanur village in Virudhachalam taluk of Cuddalore district, police said.
The level crossing is an interlocked one, meaning that unless the gates are closed, trains will not get a green signal to proceed through the intersection.
This is unlike the Semmankuppam level crossing in the district, a non-interlocked one that allowed a train to cross while the gate was open, leading to a tragic accident also involving a school van on July 8 this year. The train rammed the school van, killing three school students travelling in that.
Commenting on Monday's accident, Southern Railway termed this as a result of the negligence of the private school van driver, adding that the children sustained minor injuries and were given immediate medical aid by railway staff.
The Railway Protection Force and Government Railway Police have registered a case against the driver, who is likely to be arrested, officials said.
According to police, the van driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the crossing, causing it to capsize. No train was scheduled at the time, and villagers rushed to rescue the children, setting the vehicle back on its wheels.
""Train services were not affected as the level crossing gate is interlocked. Signals turn green only after the gates are closed. No railway assets were damaged, except for a small portion of fencing,"" Southern Railway said in a release.
It said the level crossing had been opened for road traffic as per rules, with signals on both sides showing red. The road surface was ""rubberised and in good condition,"" with speed breakers and signage in place, the release added.
Divisional Railway Manager of Tiruchirappalli Division, Balak Ram Negi, inspected the site along with senior officials.
Appealing to the public to exercise caution while crossing level crossings, Southern Railway reiterated that ""safety of the public is the topmost priority of Indian Railways"".",https://www.dtnext.in/news/tamilnadu/school-van-overturns-on-railway-track-in-virudhachalam-eight-students-injured-844437,real,0
"Varanasi teacher killed over parking row, three arrested.

VARANASI, August 23, 2025: A 42-year-old government school teacher was beaten to death following a heated argument over vehicle parking in the crowded lanes of Sigra on Thursday evening, police said. Three men have been arrested in connection with the murder of Rajesh Kumar Tiwari, a mathematics teacher at a local secondary school.
The incident occurred around 6:30 PM near Tiwari's residence on Kachahari Road when he objected to a motorcycle being parked in front of his house gate. The dispute escalated into a violent altercation that resulted in Tiwari's death, according to Sigra police station officials.
Such parking disputes have become increasingly common in Varanasi's narrow residential lanes, where growing vehicle ownership has outpaced available parking space. Local residents frequently clash over limited roadside parking, particularly in densely populated areas like Sigra and Lanka, where centuries-old infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern transportation needs.
""I heard loud shouting and came out to see what was happening,"" said Sunita Devi, a neighbor who witnessed the incident. ""Rajesh ji was asking them to move their bike, but they started using abusive language. Within minutes, more people joined them and they began hitting him with sticks.""
Another resident, Ramesh Gupta, described the scene as ""terrifying."" He said, ""The teacher was a peaceful man who never troubled anyone. He was just asking them to park somewhere else so he could take his scooter out.""
Circle Officer Manoj Kumar Singh, who is leading the investigation, said the accused have been identified as Deepak Yadav (28), Sanjay Kumar (25), and Vikash Singh (30), all residents of nearby areas. ""The altercation began over parking but turned deadly when the accused attacked Tiwari with wooden sticks and iron rods,"" Singh explained. ""We have arrested all three suspects and recovered the weapons used in the crime.""
The victim's colleagues at Saraswati Inter College expressed shock over the incident. Principal Kamla Prasad described Tiwari as a dedicated educator who had been teaching for nearly two decades. ""He was well-respected by students and staff alike. This senseless violence has left our entire school community in grief,"" Prasad said.
Parents and residents have raised concerns about the deteriorating law and order situation in residential areas. ""If a teacher cannot feel safe in his own neighborhood, what about the rest of us?"" questioned local resident Ashok Mishra.
Police have registered a case under sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita related to murder and causing grievous hurt. The accused will be presented before a magistrate for remand proceedings on Friday.
Tiwari's body has been sent for post-mortem examination at the district hospital. He is survived by his wife and two school-going children.
District authorities have announced plans to address parking issues in congested areas through designated parking zones and stricter enforcement of traffic regulations. Additional police patrolling has been ordered in residential neighborhoods following the incident.
The case has highlighted the urgent need for urban planning reforms to manage Varanasi's growing traffic congestion and prevent such tragic confrontations over basic civic amenities.

"Varanasi teacher killed over parking row, three arrested.

Varanasi: A late-night altercation over car parking at an apartment complex in Varanasi turned fatal when a 48-year-old English teacher of a Varanasi school was bludgeoned to death with bricks and rods on Thursday.

Police said the attack took place around 10:30pm at Matri Chhaya Apartment in Kabirnagar under Bhelupur police station limits in Varanasi. The accused, Adarsh Singh, son of a university professor, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, started honking on finding victim Praveen Jha's car parked in the spot he usually parked in. Jha agreed to move his vehicle, but Singh called two of his friends and started beating Jha.

Eyewitnesses said the assailants first punched and kicked Jha before hitting him on the head with bricks and rods. The apartment guard, Ram Lakhan, tried to intervene but was pushed aside. The attackers fled, leaving Jha grievously injured. He was rushed to a private hospital and later referred to BHU trauma centre, where doctors declared him dead due to severe head injuries.

ACP Gaurav Kumar along with his team launched a manhunt and arrested the three accused by 3am. Liquor bottles and cigarette packets were found in their vehicle. During interrogation, Adarsh claimed he was intoxicated and did not realise the severity of his actions.

Jha, remembered as a dedicated educator and coordinator at the school, lived in the apartment with his wife while his two sons worked and studied outside the city. His death left his family inconsolable. The school held a condolence meeting on Friday, with chairman Deepak Madhok demanding the strictest punishment for the culprits.

Police revealed that parking space was a long-standing issue in the apartment complex, which has 20 flats but only 16 designated parking slots.

DCP crime Saravanan T said that the police arrested all three accused within three hours. They were booked under section 103 (1) of BNS. The arrested persons include Adarsh Singh, Karan Gaud and Satish Patel.

Prime accused holds MBA degree, works in a multinational co

Police investigation into the brutal killing of English teacher Praveen Jha has revealed that Adarsh Singh, 27, the prime accused, holds an MBA degree and is employed as chief marketing officer with a multinational company. His father is a professor at an agriculture university in Patna. Adarsh was living alone in Matri Chhaya Apartment, Varanasi, for the past six months. Residents described him as quarrelsome.

"Deadline for property tax bills underscores issues for some Nebraska farmers.

LANCASTER COUNTY, Neb. —
Green and yellow as far as the eye can see: even under cloudy skies, it's a private paradise for Tom Peterson and his family on a farm near Waverly.

But it takes a different kind of green to keep the land, and seemingly more and more of it each year.

""We're just about buying this ground again in taxes,"" Peterson said. ""And we're having to do that during the season, too.""

Peterson is one of the many farmers in Lancaster County whose property tax bill deadline is at the end of the day on Thursday. Otherwise, the taxes are delinquent. Farmers and homeowners, facing soaring valuations, have chafed at the tax issue for years.

MORE COVERAGE: Dozens of farmers voice frustrations over surging property valuations

""The profit that we make, if we make any of that, goes towards paying your taxes and anything outside of an actual input,"" Peterson said.

Peterson said this year has at least been easier on grain producers in terms of drought conditions. But with high input costs and low commodity prices, the steady summer rains have been more of a necessity than a boon, he said.

""Going to have to raise a lot of bushels to hope to get above that break-even point,"" he said.

State Sen. Tom Brandt has seen the issue firsthand, both as a farmer and a lawmaker.

""What's happening with ag land is there is a disconnect between what the ground earns and what you pay in taxes,"" he said.

Brandt said he's worked to rectify that disconnect in the Unicameral, but he said it's a difficult issue because counties and cities heavily rely on the tax for revenue.

""You'll never eliminate property taxes, but I think there's things that we can do in the state to make it more manageable,"" he said. ""Nebraska needs to change the valuation component.""

Gov. Jim Pillen, who's touted his efforts to relieve property taxes, said in a statement that property taxpayers ""will be making property tax payments today, that are on average, 25% lower than the previous year.""

Pillen said there's still more work to do.

""We need to broaden our sales tax to fix the property tax crisis and decrease income taxes. Everyone knows this, but special interest groups have duped some key voters in the Unicameral. We will fix the tax crisis in Nebraska,"" Pillen said.

Peterson said he's hoping to see more action from the state in the future.

""There needs to be more balance in the three-legged stool of our revenue,"" he said, referring to property, sales and income taxes.",https://www.ketv.com/article/nebraska-deadline-for-property-tax-bills/65568796,real,0
"Deadline for property tax bills underscores issues for some Nebraska farmers.

LINCOLN, Neb. — As the August 1st deadline for property tax bills looms across Nebraska, many farmers in the state are finding themselves grappling with more than just paperwork — they’re confronting a system they say has long failed to reflect the economic realities of agriculture.

For generations, farmland has been taxed based on its assessed market value. But with land prices skyrocketing in recent years — often due to speculative buying, not farming returns — many producers say their tax bills have become unsustainable.

""I’m paying taxes on land that’s worth more to an investor than it is to me as a farmer,"" said Don Weller, a fourth-generation corn and soybean producer in Gage County. “The market says it's worth $12,000 an acre, but I can't make that kind of return growing crops.”

According to the Nebraska Department of Revenue, the average agricultural land value in the state has increased nearly 260% over the past two decades. Meanwhile, net farm income has remained volatile, buffeted by global commodity markets, weather extremes, and rising input costs.

The mismatch is particularly painful this year as drought conditions across parts of the state have cut yields, and interest rates have made it harder for family farms to borrow money to pay their bills.

The Nebraska Farm Bureau has long called for property tax reform, advocating for a system that taxes agricultural land based on its income-producing potential rather than its market value — a shift known as ""use-value assessment.""

""We’re not asking for a break — we’re asking for fairness,"" said Farm Bureau President Mark McHargue. “Property taxes remain the single largest tax burden for Nebraska farmers and ranchers. Without structural change, more family operations are at risk.”

Some lawmakers agree. State Senator Tom Brandt of Plymouth has introduced legislation that would reduce ag land valuations for tax purposes, but the proposals have faced stiff opposition from school districts and local governments that rely on property taxes for funding.

""We understand the farmers' concerns,"" said Teresa Vann, a superintendent in the Sandhills region. “But any reduction in ag land taxes would force schools like ours to make hard choices — and possibly cut staff or programs.”

In the meantime, farmers like Weller are doing what they always do: finding ways to survive. But with each passing year, the pressure mounts.

""I’m not asking to be exempt from taxes,"" he said. “I’m just asking that they don’t bury us before we’ve even harvested the crop.”

As the tax deadline passes, conversations in coffee shops, co-ops, and Capitol hearing rooms alike reflect a growing urgency — one that pits the financial lifeblood of rural Nebraska against the fiscal demands of its institutions.","Hi ChatGPT!

"Oklahoma high school athletes could soon cash in on additional NIL Deals.

In Oklahoma, Friday night lights are serious business. Now, a new partnership could let high school athletes benefit from additional Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) opportunities.

Bryan Bedford, CEO of the Oklahoma City–based Bedford Agency, says the influencer economy is changing the game.

“We really felt like that was a missing gap, a missing opportunity for the high school space,” Bedford said. “They aren’t structured like colleges; they don’t have the staff, and the rules are different.”

Bedford’s agency is teaming up with Opendorse — a national NIL platform already used by universities like the University of Oklahoma. Together, they’ll offer athletes a branded marketplace, consulting, training, and support, all through a mobile app.

“They’ll create a bio and their social platforms, so they can have a centralized place for brands and parties to do NIL deals through a common marketplace,” Bedford explained.

Former OU quarterback Charles Thompson has already seen the impact of NIL on his own son, Casey, and believes these new tools could open even more doors for Oklahoma’s young athletes.

“They do provide not just the opportunity to make money, but they also provide educational material and programs as well,” Thompson said. “If you combine the two, I think it’s like anything else. The quicker we can learn how to earn and learn how to save, and maybe make better choices with our financial choices, the better.”

Thompson, who now helps run youth football in Oklahoma, admits NIL has critics but compares it to opportunities athletes have always had.

“There are a lot of people who will say this is unfair,” Thompson said. “But it’s the same thing when people are getting a scholarship and not getting a scholarship. Same type of variation.”",https://www.poncacitynow.com/local/oklahoma-high-school-athletes-could-soon-cash-in-on-additional-nil-deals/,real,0
"Oklahoma high school athletes could soon cash in on additional NIL Deals.

OKLAHOMA CITY — High school athletes across Oklahoma may soon have new opportunities to profit from their athletic talents, as state lawmakers consider legislation that would expand name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals for student-athletes below the college level.
The proposed bill, introduced by State Representative Maria Chen, would allow high school athletes to enter into endorsement agreements, social media partnerships, and other commercial arrangements while maintaining their eligibility for interscholastic competition. The legislation comes as several other states have begun exploring similar measures following the success of college NIL programs.
""Our high school athletes are already building substantial followings on social media and generating interest from local businesses,"" Chen said during a committee hearing Tuesday. ""This legislation would simply formalize what's already happening organically in our communities.""
Under the proposed framework, student-athletes would be permitted to sign deals with local restaurants, clothing stores, training facilities, and other businesses, provided the agreements don't conflict with existing school partnerships or involve prohibited substances like alcohol or tobacco. Schools would not be allowed to facilitate or profit from these arrangements directly.
The Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association (OSSAA) has expressed cautious optimism about the proposal, noting that proper oversight would be essential to maintain competitive balance and academic priorities.
""We want to ensure that any NIL opportunities enhance rather than detract from the educational experience,"" said OSSAA Executive Director Robert Mills. ""Student-athletes are students first, and that principle must remain paramount.""
If passed, Oklahoma would join a growing number of states reconsidering traditional amateur athletics rules at the high school level. The legislation is expected to face a full committee vote next month.","generate a news article that could have the same title as this real one.

"Roosevelt Before Hours.

At first glance, early mornings at Roosevelt seem quiet. That is, until you get a peek inside various classrooms. In the early hours, you can find students doing homework, practicing for music concerts, or getting ready for sports. Despite the early start times at Roosevelt, students seem to be as passionate about their activities as they are about their academics.

Why do students at Roosevelt come to school early and how early? Elena Martinovic ’26 comes to school early twice a week for cheer practice. Martinovic gets to school around 6:30 a.m. When asked about
the benefits of starting the day early, she responded “start- ing off your day active and having a schedule that is consistent makes you motivated.”

However, for her schedule, it’s important that she gets enough sleep. “When I have to be awake for that long, I definitely find myself super tired and drowsing off usually around 4th or 5th period,” she said. She usually gets her energy back around 6th period.

Finley Ross ’26 comes to school early twice a week for Jazz Band One. Ross, a baritone, has always loved singing. “I’ve been singing for about six years now and I really love it… singing with the band is amazing and such a great chance for me to become a better singer.”

Despite its earliness, Ross enjoys his mornings at Roosevelt. He gets to spend time doing something he
loves, and “it’s nice to be here and have time to do things like that.” To arrive that early, Ross wakes up around 6:30 a.m.

Ross isn’t mad about Roosevelt’s start time but “any earlier would be pushing it and it would make things harder for before school activities.” In the morning, the busy classrooms reflect the abundance of extracurricular activities available for students at Roosevelt.

"Changi Airport handles 17.5 million passengers in Q2 2025.

SINGAPORE – Changi Airport handled about 17.5 million passenger movements from April to June, 5.9 per cent more than in the same period in 2024.

This also marked a 4 per cent increase from the number of passenger movements recorded in the second quarter of 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic struck.

The latest statistics were released by airport operator Changi Airport Group (CAG) in a press release on July 22.

The airport recorded 5.78 million passenger movements in April, 5.82 million in May and 5.88 million in June, according to passenger traffic figures published on Changi Airport’s website.

China was Changi Airport’s biggest market in the second quarter of 2025 by passenger traffic, followed by Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and India, CAG said.

Traffic between Singapore and China registered a 15.8 per cent year-on-year increase, while traffic to and from Indonesia grew 12 per cent in the same period.

In January, then Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat said the authorities expect traffic volumes at Changi Airport in 2025 to exceed pre-pandemic levels.

Changi Airport handled 67.7 million passengers in 2024, reaching 99.1 per cent of the record 68.3 million handled in 2019.

Mr Lim Ching Kiat, CAG’s executive vice-president for air hub and cargo development, said the airport saw healthy growth in passenger traffic from April to June.

Noting that traffic to and from China and Indonesia showed particularly strong growth, Mr Lim said this demonstrated Changi Airport’s ongoing efforts to boost travel demand in the region.

There were 93,600 aircraft movements – which include landings and take-offs – at Changi Airport in the first quarter of 2025, up 4.9 per cent from the same period in 2024.

In the second quarter of 2025, Changi Airport was linked to new cities, including Vienna in Austria, Kota Bharu in Malaysia and Nha Trang in Vietnam.

Following the closure of Singapore-based budget carrier Jetstar Asia on July 31, two of four routes previously served exclusively by the airline – Okinawa in Japan and Labuan Bajo in Indonesia – will be operated by Scoot starting some time between October 2025 and March 2026.

China’s Juneyao Air will take over the former Qantas subsidiary’s services between Singapore and Wuxi in China from Aug 29.

But connectivity to Broome in Australia will remain lost with the closure of Jetstar Asia.

As at July 1, about 100 airlines operate more than 7,200 weekly scheduled flights at Changi Airport, connecting Singapore to around 170 cities in 50 countries and territories worldwide.

CAG noted that T’Way Air, Philippine Airlines, Myanmar National Airlines and Myanmar Airways International will move to Terminal 2 in the coming months, as part of efforts to optimise resources across the airport’s terminals.

"Winnie’s Wagon delivers kids’ science experiments to shelters and sidewalks.

PITTSBURGH, PA — On a sun-drenched Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh's Allentown neighborhood, a curious sight draws a small crowd. Parked near the corner of Arlington Avenue and Warrington, a vintage 1970s Ford Econoline van, painted a brilliant shade of cerulean blue and adorned with whimsical, hand-painted gears, planets, and bubbling beakers, has its side panel wide open. This is ""Winnie’s Wagon,"" and for the children gathering around, it’s a portal to a world of wonder. Inside, instead of ice cream, Dr. Alistair Finch, a retired Carnegie Mellon University chemistry professor with a wild mane of white hair and a perpetually twinkling eye, is handing out safety goggles and instructions for making ""Oobleck.""

The scene is a familiar one in an increasing number of Pittsburgh neighborhoods. For the past eighteen months, Winnie’s Wagon has become a beacon of curiosity, a mobile science laboratory dedicated to bringing hands-on, engaging STEM experiments directly to children in underserved communities, homeless shelters, and community centers across the city. The project is the brainchild of Dr. Finch, who, after a distinguished 40-year career in academia, decided his retirement would be anything but retiring.

""I spent a lifetime in university labs, surrounded by brilliant minds and cutting-edge technology,"" Dr. Finch explains, his voice a gentle rumble as he helps a young girl measure out cornstarch. ""But science doesn’t belong in an ivory tower. It belongs to everyone. It’s in the way a ball bounces, the way bread rises, the way the sun warms the pavement. I wanted to take that magic, that fundamental curiosity, and put it directly into the hands of kids who might not otherwise get to experience it.""

The wagon is named after his late wife, Winifred, a beloved elementary school teacher who shared his passion for education. After she passed away three years ago, Dr. Finch felt a profound need to honor her legacy. He sold his second car, dipped into his retirement savings, and purchased the old van. With the help of a few mechanically inclined former students, he transformed it into a fully-equipped, self-contained laboratory on wheels. It’s a marvel of compact engineering, with fold-out tables, built-in storage for beakers and test tubes, a solar-powered generator for running small electronics, and even a retractable awning for rainy days.

The experiments are the heart of the operation. Dr. Finch has meticulously designed dozens of them to be safe, inexpensive, and incredibly engaging. They eschew complex theory for the sheer joy of discovery. One day, kids might be building simple circuits with batteries, wires, and LED bulbs to understand electricity. The next, they could be launching miniature catapults built from popsicle sticks and rubber bands to learn about potential and kinetic energy. A perennial favorite is creating ""volcanic"" eruptions using baking soda and vinegar, a classic that never fails to elicit squeals of delight. Another popular activity involves extracting DNA from a strawberry using household items like dish soap and rubbing alcohol.

""The goal isn't to lecture them on molecular biology,"" Finch says with a chuckle. ""It's to let them see, with their own eyes, the stringy, gooey stuff that makes up a living thing. It’s about that 'wow' moment. That’s the spark. Once you have that spark, the learning follows.""

Winnie's Wagon operates on a simple, flexible schedule, primarily communicated through partnerships with local community organizations and a modest social media presence. Two days a week, it visits shelters like the East End Cooperative Ministry or family housing centers in the Hill District. On weekends, it sets up on sidewalks in neighborhoods from Sheraden to Hazelwood, becoming an impromptu science fair for anyone who wanders by.

Maria Flores, a program director at a women and children's shelter in the North Side, speaks of the wagon's profound impact. ""For the children here, life is often filled with uncertainty and instability. The wagon provides a moment of pure, joyful normalcy. For an hour, they aren't just kids in a shelter; they are scientists, engineers, and inventors. We see their confidence blossom. A child who is normally shy and withdrawn will suddenly be eagerly explaining how their circuit works. It’s more than just an activity; it’s therapeutic.""

The program is a family affair. Dr. Finch’s daughter, Sarah Finch, a graphic designer, created the wagon's vibrant branding and helps manage the logistics. His son-in-law, a high school physics teacher, often volunteers on weekends. A small but dedicated team of college students from the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University also volunteer their time, serving as mentors and assistants.

For these volunteers, the experience is transformative. ""In my university classes, we talk about educational disparities and the importance of outreach,"" says Chloe Zhang, a junior studying neuroscience at Pitt. ""But being here, seeing a kid's face light up when they successfully create a stable, multi-colored density tower from sugar water... it makes it real. You're not just reading about a problem; you're actively participating in a solution.""

Of course, running a nonprofit from the back of a van isn't without its challenges. Funding is a constant concern. Most supplies are paid for out of Dr. Finch's pocket, supplemented by small grants and donations from a growing base of supporters. Pittsburgh's unpredictable weather can scuttle a planned sidewalk session, and navigating the city's narrow, hilly streets in a 50-year-old vehicle is an adventure in itself.

Yet, for Dr. Finch, the rewards far outweigh the difficulties. He shares the story of a 10-year-old boy named Leo whom he met at a community center in Homewood. Leo was quiet and reserved at first, observing from a distance. Dr. Finch was demonstrating how to build a small solar-powered car from a kit. Intrigued, Leo slowly joined the group. He followed the instructions with intense focus, and when his car finally zipped across the pavement under the afternoon sun, his face broke into an unforgettable, triumphant grin. A few months later, the community center's director called Dr. Finch. Leo had entered the school district’s science fair with an expanded project on solar energy, winning second place in his division.

""That’s it, right there,"" Dr. Finch says, his eyes misting over slightly at the memory. ""That’s why we do this. It’s not about creating an army of future scientists, though that would be lovely. It’s about empowering children to ask questions, to experiment, to fail and try again. It’s about teaching them to look at the world around them and not just see what is, but to wonder what could be.""

As the afternoon in Allentown winds down, the Oobleck—a non-Newtonian fluid that acts as a solid when pressure is applied and a liquid when it's not—is a messy, gooey success. Children laugh as they punch the surface and watch their fingers sink slowly when they relax their hands. Parents who were initially hesitant are now kneeling on the sidewalk, equally fascinated. Before packing up, Dr. Finch gives each child a small bag with the ingredients and a recipe card so they can recreate the experiment at home.

With the fold-out tables stowed and the last of the cornstarch swept away, the cerulean blue van rumbles to life. As Winnie's Wagon pulls away from the curb, a chorus of small voices yells, ""Thank you! Come back soon!"" Dr. Alistair Finch gives a cheerful wave, another successful mission complete, leaving behind a sidewalk dusted with cornstarch and a neighborhood buzzing with the infectious, joyful energy of scientific discovery.","You need to generate a news article based on this headline.

A bright blue van pulled up to the curb, its bold, white lettering proclaiming, “Winnie’s Wagon.” The students ran to the van, shouting excitedly, “We’re making a volcano!”


Instructors Renna Brown and Kaitlyn Nykwest extended an awning from the top of the van and set out stools, transforming the sidewalk into a pop-up classroom. It was the third STEAM education workshop hosted by the Homeless Children’s Education Fund [HCEF] initiative, Winnie’s Wagon, since launching in 2023 as the nation’s first mobile classroom.

The van grew out of HCEF’s mobile learning program that brings free and hands-on tutoring to K-8 students experiencing homelessness. 

Brown, HCEF’s STEAM mobile learning coordinator, passed out cups filled with sand to each student and guided them through a fun science experiment. Their goal? To discover which type of vinegar would cause a bigger reaction by building a mini volcano in a cup.

She asked the students to sprinkle baking soda on top of the sand and then pour a glass of white vinegar on top. Instantly, a frothy eruption bubbled over the edges. 

“Woah, that’s crazy!” said ten-year-old Khloe. 

“How does it feel like? How is the cup from the outside?” Brown asked, prompting the students to touch and explore the reaction. 

“It’s hot!” said six-year-old Hailey. “It feels like a soft pear,” she added, digging her fingers into the foamy mixture. 

“When you touch it, it’s warm,” said Brown. “That’s how you know it’s a chemical reaction.”

Brown uses the mobile classroom to experiment with everyday household items and make science more inclusive and understandable. Over the past few weeks, Hailey, Khloe and Faith have enjoyed making volcanoes, smoothies and tie-dye shirts — all in the name of science. 

“That’s the benefit of a mobile classroom,” Brown said. “Students first immerse within an environment that looks like a classroom, but it is able to travel anywhere.”

Nykwest, senior director of programs at HCEF, said the program is targeted toward students experiencing housing instability, particularly those who live outside of shelters. The mobile learning program began in early 2021, when the HCEF staff started delivering supplies to students who lacked transportation to pick them up from schools. From there, it evolved to offering tutoring services to students at their homes.

A recent report by the state Department of Education’s Education for Children and Youth Experiencing Homelessness revealed a 17% increase in the number of students experiencing homelessness in Allegheny County from the previous year. More than half of the county’s unhoused students were chronically absent from school, resulting in learning loss because of missed classes. Of the total students experiencing homelessness, 70% were doubled up in shared housing situations and only 18% were living in shelters or transitional housing.

The mobile learning program works to bridge the learning gaps that affect students transitioning between temporary living situations. 

“When you’re dealing with some of the challenges that our students, our families are facing, it’s easy to get intimidated if you miss a few days of school here and there and it starts to build up,” Nykwest said. 

Winnie’s Wagon travels across the Pittsburgh region, offering personalized tutoring services by meeting students where they are. It also stops at shelters to deliver STEM and STEAM workshops. So far this year, the mobile learning program has tutored 130 students.

After finishing up at the Sojourner building in Squirrel Hill, Nykwest drove Winnie’s Wagon to West Mifflin to meet Ada Quinones, whose three children had a weekly mobile learning tutoring session.

As the Wagon pulled into the parking lot by the house, tutor Madeline Phillips and volunteer Shirley Gibson walked up with the students — Pedro, Reinalee and Angelee. It was the children’s first tutoring session inside Winnie’s Wagon. 

Inside, the van had been transformed into a cozy, vibrant classroom. A small table and stools formed a workspace, with a cushioned bench running along the side. Another shelved wall is stacked with a colorful library of books, games and toys. The Wagon also keeps snacks and stationery supplies and tech tools such as Wi-Fi, a 3D printer and tablets for the students to use.

Quinones has used HCEF services since 2021, when she was living in a shelter. The organization continued supporting the family after she moved into her current house in West Mifflin by providing math, tutoring and reading support to her kids. 

Without that, keeping her kids on track with school would have been challenging, Quinones said. “They make them read. Some of them don’t like to read, so they have to read. … which is good, because in school, they’re going to do more than that.”

Phillips kicked off the class with a creative writing prompt: “A strange spaceship has crashed in your backyard. What would you do?”

Eight-year-old Reinalee wrote about aliens emerging from the spaceship and attacking her family. She loves reading and picked out a book about elephants while snacking on applesauce. 

Her brother, Pedro, 10, wasn’t interested in writing that day. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the floor playing a game of Connect 4. 

Thirteen-year-old Angelee curled up on the cushioned bench with Gibson, wrapped in a blue blanket. Her story involved fixing the spaceship and then breaking it again. She is passionate about drawing cats, humans and roses and is currently learning Spanish. She wants to be a teacher when she grows up.

"Retrieved Chola-era Ardhanarisvara sculpture to be on public display at Vriddachalam temple.

A centuries-old Chola-era Ardhanārīśvara sculpture, recently repatriated to India after being traced overseas, will soon be placed on permanent public display at the Vriddachalam temple in Tamil Nadu’s Cuddalore district.

The 11th-century stone sculpture, depicting Ardhanārīśvara — the composite form of Lord Śiva and Goddess Pārvatī — was stolen several decades ago from the Vriddhagireeswarar Temple, an important Chola-period heritage site. Following coordinated efforts by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the Idol Wing of the Tamil Nadu Police, and international agencies, the artifact was successfully recovered and returned earlier this year.

Archaeologists describe the sculpture as a fine example of Chola craftsmanship, notable for its balanced iconography. The figure combines masculine and feminine attributes, with Śiva’s half holding the trident and matted locks, while Pārvatī’s half carries delicate ornaments and flowing drapery. Experts say its stylistic detailing places it in the late 10th or early 11th century, during the reign of the later Cholas.

Speaking about the development, temple authorities confirmed that the idol will be installed within a secure enclosure inside the Vriddhagireeswarar Temple complex, with arrangements for devotees and visitors to view it. Conservation measures will ensure both ritual sanctity and heritage protection.

“This is not just about the return of a stolen idol,” said an official from the Idol Wing. “It is the restoration of cultural memory and continuity for the local community.”

The display is expected to draw historians, art enthusiasts, and pilgrims alike, reaffirming Vriddachalam’s status as an important center of Chola-era art and Shaivite worship.",generate a news article with the following title: Retrieved Chola-era Ardhanarisvara sculpture to be on public display at Vriddachalam temple,fake,1

"Tiruppur dowry death: Husband, in-laws subjected Rithanya to cruelty, reveals police investigation.

Tiruppur, July 23, 2025 — The police investigation into the tragic death of 26-year-old Rithanya has revealed disturbing details of sustained cruelty by her husband and in-laws, shedding light on the harsh realities of dowry harassment in the region. The incident, which has sparked outrage across Tamil Nadu, underscores the urgent need for stringent enforcement of anti-dowry laws and protection for vulnerable women.

Who and What Happened
Rithanya, a resident of Tiruppur, was found dead in her marital home late last week. According to police reports, she was subjected to continuous mental and physical harassment by her husband, Arjun, and his family over alleged dowry demands. The cruelty reportedly escalated over several months, culminating in the fatal incident.

“The deceased was repeatedly threatened and abused due to unmet dowry expectations,” said Inspector Ramesh Kumar, leading the investigation. “Our preliminary findings indicate a clear pattern of harassment and ill-treatment.”

When and Where
The incident took place in Tiruppur district, a textile hub known for its thriving garment industry. Rithanya’s body was discovered on July 17, 2025, in the couple’s rented accommodation on the outskirts of the city. The police were alerted by neighbors after hearing commotion and unusual silence from the house.

Why It Is Significant
Dowry-related violence remains a pressing social issue in India, despite legal prohibitions under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. This case highlights the persistent challenges faced by women who are often coerced into demanding dowries and suffer abuse when these demands are not met.

“Rithanya’s case is a heartbreaking example of the deep-rooted cultural malaise that continues to victimize countless women,” said Meena Raj, a women’s rights activist. “It is imperative that society and authorities take decisive action to eradicate this practice.”

How Events Unfolded
According to the police, after the marriage in early 2024, tensions arose over dowry demands, including cash and household items that the bride’s family struggled to provide. The harassment reportedly involved verbal abuse, threats, and physical violence. Medical examinations confirmed signs of assault prior to her death.

Following the discovery, Arjun and his parents were taken into custody and are currently under investigation for charges including cruelty and abetment to suicide. The police have also begun interviewing relatives and neighbors to piece together a timeline of events.

Voices from the Community
Neighbors expressed shock and sadness at the incident. “We heard shouting and crying for days, but no one knew the full extent of her suffering,” said Rekha, a resident of the neighborhood. “It is tragic that she had to endure this in silence.”

Local authorities have pledged swift action and support for the victim’s family. The district magistrate has called for awareness campaigns to educate communities on the consequences of dowry harassment.","Write a detailed news article based on the title: ""Tiruppur dowry death: Husband, in-laws subjected Rithanya to cruelty, reveals police investigation"" The article should include the key facts such as who is involved, what happened, when and where it took place, why it is significant, and how events unfolded.

Datong Cultural Heritage Shines at Shanxi Cultural Expo

Taiyuan, China — August 26, 2025

The rich historical and cultural legacy of Datong took center stage this week at the Shanxi Cultural Expo, captivating audiences with immersive exhibits, live performances, and cutting-edge digital presentations that celebrated the city’s role as a cradle of Chinese civilization.

Held in the Shanxi Expo Center, the multi-day event gathered cultural institutions, artisans, scholars, and tourists from across the province and beyond. Among all the showcases, Datong — once the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty and home to the UNESCO-listed Yungang Grottoes — emerged as a highlight of the event, demonstrating its unique blend of ancient heritage and modern innovation.

A Journey Through Time

Datong’s pavilion, themed “Where Stone Speaks and History Breathes”, drew crowds with a striking digital recreation of the Yungang Grottoes. Visitors experienced high-resolution 3D scans of the ancient Buddhist cave sculptures, brought to life through projection mapping and interactive touch screens. “This is the first time we’ve fused AI-guided narration with tactile feedback systems,” said Zhang Ming, head of Datong’s cultural bureau. “It’s part of our mission to make heritage not only accessible but also emotionally resonant.”

The pavilion also featured replica artifacts from the Huayan Monastery and Nine Dragon Wall, along with exhibits tracing Datong’s industrial history and its transformation into a modern energy and cultural tourism hub.

Traditional Meets Contemporary

In addition to its historical attractions, Datong brought living culture to the forefront. Local artisans demonstrated traditional crafts like shadow puppetry, glazed ceramics, and intricate paper cutting, while performers showcased Shanxi opera and Mongolian throat singing — a nod to Datong’s frontier city roots and ethnic diversity.

One of the most talked-about performances was a multimedia dance drama reenacting the Buddhist monk Tan Yao’s vision behind the Yungang Grottoes. Combining choreography, holographic visuals, and ancient instrumentals, the performance received standing ovations from attendees.

Collaboration and Innovation

A key moment of the expo was the signing of several cultural cooperation agreements between Datong and institutions from Beijing and Xi’an, aiming to promote shared research, tourism development, and digital preservation efforts. “Datong is becoming a model for how second-tier cities can protect their past while investing in cultural innovation,” said Li Yuhong, director of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Culture.

To support this, the Datong Digital Heritage Initiative was unveiled — a new platform for open-access 3D models, AR experiences, and educational materials for schools across China. The project is backed by Tsinghua University and Tencent’s AI Lab.

A Bright Future for Cultural Tourism

As Datong continues to position itself as both a guardian of ancient China and a pioneer of digital heritage, the expo highlighted its evolving role on the national cultural map. With over 500,000 online viewers and thousands of in-person visits during the expo, city officials are hopeful this momentum will carry forward into increased tourism and global recognition.

“This isn’t just about preserving statues or temples,” said Zhang Ming. “It’s about telling China’s story through Datong — and making sure the world listens.”","Please generate a news article with the title below:

Datong's booth at the seventh Shanxi Cultural Industries Fair, held from Aug 21 to 25 in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, captivated visitors with its rich array of intangible cultural heritage products.

One of the booth's standout attractions was its exquisite copperware collection. Classic items such as copper hot pots, kettles, and kitchenware were showcased alongside innovative cultural products that blend modern techniques with traditional craftsmanship.

""We have brought over 50 products, preserving traditional skills while incorporating Datong elements. We hope this exhibition will attract more people to experience the charm of our intangible heritage,"" said Li Yanlin, a recognized inheritor of Datong's copperware craftsmanship.

Volcanic stone carvings also drew significant interest, with many visitors eager to learn from Liu Jian, an expert in this unique art form. Items such as tea sets, fridge magnets, and incense burners, infused with cultural elements, transformed dormant volcanic rocks into artistic vessels of cultural heritage.

Equally admired were straw-woven products, celebrated for their diverse patterns, exceptional quality, and simple elegance. Baskets, tables, chairs, and trays carry deep cultural significance and offer both aesthetic and practical value.

"Eco-friendly burials have progressively gained ground in the Colombian market.
.

The ""Ashes as a Source of Life"" program supports reforestation through the planting of native trees such as the Bear's Hand.

The funeral sector has been implementing a series of ecological practices to reduce the environmental impact it may generate through the provision of services to citizens and pets. These practices include the proper disposal of ashes resulting from the cremation process, which have different uses, such as cremation urns, for which conventional urns are used for storage and disposal.

There are also more ecological alternatives to urns, allowing disposal at sea, allowing both the container and the ashes to disintegrate without affecting biodiversity, warn spokespersons for the National Committee of the Funeral Sector of Fenalco.

They also emphasize that eco-friendly burials offer several environmental benefits by minimizing the impact of funeral processes on the environment. These include preserving natural resources, reducing carbon emissions, protecting water and soil quality, and promoting biodiversity.

According to María del Pilar Rojas Bustamante, executive director of the Remanso Corporation: “In Colombia, there are two ways to dispose of bodies—although other practices already exist around the world, with different and more environmentally friendly technologies, such as alkaline hydrolysis or accusation. One is inhumation, which is the placement of the body in the ground or in a vault, and the other is cremation, which consists of the decomposition of the body through a combustion process.” Along these lines, she notes that, today, and with increased growth after Covid, cremation is the first preference among families who can afford it.

“The ashes are given to the family members, and they are the ones who decide what to do with them or where to dispose of them. Some funeral homes—very few in Colombia—offer the option of taking them to an ash forest, where they bury the ashes and plant a tree in memory of the deceased. Other people prefer to take them to a church or leave them in a cemetery,” Rojas explains. It has also become popular—as a ritual—to take the ashes to a river or the sea, where they throw the ash forest—a biodegradable container—into the water or simply scatter the cremated remains.

Rojas explains: “In human funeral services, we are not aware of a 100 percent eco-friendly funeral home; they are companies that offer the burial of ashes and plant trees. However, in pet services, there are completely eco-friendly entities that use composting processes.”

Initiatives...

Among the programs being developed on this topic is ""Ashes, Source of Life,"" an initiative that offers families a very special way to honor their deceased loved ones: planting their ashes directly in the roots of a tree, says engineer Margarita Ballesteros, of the environmental NGO Colombia Reserva de Vida. She emphasizes that this proposal does not use polluting urns, caskets, or bags; the ashes rest directly in the ground, nourishing new life. The idea is for families to actively participate in planting these trees, creating a dignified and meaningful tribute to their loved ones. It is a moment to remember and connect with nature in a profound way, Ballesteros points out.

To date, more than 23,000 trees have been planted through this program, each one representing a living memory and a contribution to our environment, Ballesteros emphasizes. Currently, the funeral homes offering the ""Ashes as a Source of Life"" program include: La Luz Funeral Home, Gaviria Funeral Home, Zipaquirá Cemetery Park, and Jardines. ""They invite families to join this beautiful work of reforesting our páramo, contributing to the generation of water, life, and oxygen with each planting,"" says Ballesteros.

It's worth noting that this program is carried out in an environmental reserve located in Cogua, Cundinamarca, near the Neusa Dam. Reforestation involves planting native trees, including: Rodamonte, Mano de oso, Laurel de cera, and Arrayán. The family of the deceased can choose which one to plant on the day of the planting.",https://www.agronegocios.co/mascotas/sepelios-ecologicos-ganan-terreno-en-mercado-colombiano-4189541,real,0
"Eco-friendly burials have progressively gained ground in the Colombian market.
.

In recent years, eco-friendly burials have seen a notable rise in popularity across Colombia, reflecting a growing environmental consciousness and shifting cultural attitudes toward death and remembrance.

Once considered a niche practice, green burials—characterized by biodegradable coffins, natural gravesites, and minimal environmental impact—are steadily gaining traction among urban and rural communities alike. The movement is particularly visible in cities like Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali, where both private and public initiatives have embraced sustainable funeral alternatives.

“The idea is to return to the earth in the most natural way possible,” says Ana María Restrepo, founder of Raíces Eternas, a Colombian company specializing in ecological burials. “We use untreated wood, cotton shrouds, and preserve native vegetation around burial sites. Families see it as a way to honor life by protecting the environment even after death.”

In a country where traditional Catholic funerals and elaborate mausoleums have long dominated the landscape, the rise of green funerals marks a cultural shift. According to a 2024 study by the Universidad de los Andes, over 15% of urban Colombians under 40 now express a preference for environmentally sustainable burial options.

The Colombian government has also begun to take notice. In 2023, the Ministry of Environment issued new guidelines to regulate and encourage the use of natural cemeteries, providing legal clarity and incentives for municipalities to adapt plots of land for conservation burials.

Environmental advocates point out that traditional burials, involving embalming chemicals and non-biodegradable caskets, contribute to soil and groundwater contamination. Cremation, while less land-intensive, releases carbon emissions and heavy metals into the atmosphere.

“Incorporating eco-friendly practices into end-of-life planning is one of the most impactful personal choices someone can make,” explains Luis Alberto Pardo, an environmental scientist and advisor to Colombia’s National Funeral Association. “It’s not just about death; it’s about the legacy we leave behind.”

Despite the momentum, barriers remain. Religious traditions, limited public awareness, and uneven access to green burial services in rural regions continue to challenge the movement’s growth. Still, advocates remain optimistic.

“Colombia is a country rich in biodiversity and deep spiritual connection to the land,” Restrepo adds. “Eco-burials are not a rejection of tradition—they’re an evolution of it.”

As demand increases, more funeral homes are beginning to offer green packages, and public cemeteries are allocating sections for natural burials. With the continued support of environmentalists, policymakers, and a new generation of eco-conscious Colombians, the trend appears poised for long-term growth.",Write a news article with the title: Eco-friendly burials have progressively gained ground in the Colombian market.,fake,1
" Historic Moravian Bethlehem to celebrate recognition on world stage with hometown party .

Bethlehem, PA — July 25, 2025

The city of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, will host a jubilant hometown celebration this weekend to honor the recent global recognition of Historic Moravian Bethlehem, now officially inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

This landmark achievement places the 18th-century settlement, founded by German-speaking Moravian missionaries in 1741, among a distinguished list of cultural sites around the world — including the Great Wall of China and the Pyramids of Egypt.

“This is not just a recognition of Bethlehem’s past,” said Mayor J. William Reynolds. “It’s a celebration of the values that shaped our city — education, community, craftsmanship, and faith — and a statement to the world that this place matters.”
A Global Milestone, A Local Celebration

To mark the occasion, Bethlehem will host a full weekend of festivities from July 26–28 in and around the Historic District. Events will include:

    A public ceremony and flag-raising at Central Moravian Church

    Live music and performances by local Moravian and multicultural groups

    Heritage walking tours with costumed interpreters and historians

    Children’s activities including candle-making, tin punching, and storytelling

    A community potluck and street fair on Main Street featuring local vendors

The celebration is expected to draw thousands of residents, history enthusiasts, and international guests.
Centuries of Legacy

Historic Moravian Bethlehem encompasses a remarkable collection of 18th-century structures, including Gemeinhaus (the oldest surviving Moravian building in North America), the Single Sisters' House, and the colonial industrial quarter. The UNESCO designation recognizes the site’s unique testimony to early communal life and spiritual ideals.

Scholars have long praised the Moravians for their progressive social organization, including early education for girls and interracial community building — values that set Bethlehem apart from other colonial settlements.
Community Effort, Global Impact

The UNESCO inscription follows years of dedicated work by local historians, preservationists, the Bethlehem World Heritage Commission, and community stakeholders. The site is now part of a transnational inscription with similar Moravian settlements in Herrnhut, Germany, and Gracehill, Northern Ireland.

“This moment is the culmination of over a decade of collaboration,” said Charlene Donchez Mowers, President of Historic Bethlehem Museums & Sites. “It is a recognition not just of what was built here, but of how people lived — and how their values still resonate today.”
Looking Ahead

With its new World Heritage status, Bethlehem anticipates increased tourism, educational partnerships, and global cultural exchanges. City officials are also working to secure funding for ongoing conservation efforts and to expand community programs tied to the site’s legacy.

As celebrations kick off, residents are encouraged to wear traditional Moravian stars and bring candles to Friday evening’s lantern-lit procession.

“This isn’t just history in a textbook,” said Mayor Reynolds. “It’s history that lives and breathes — and now the world knows it too.”",Make a news article for the folllowing headline:  Historic Moravian Bethlehem to celebrate recognition on world stage with hometown party ,fake,1

"Teen driver killed in Chula Vista street race crash.



**Chula Vista, CA – July 29, 2025** – A 17-year-old driver was tragically killed last night in a suspected street racing incident on East Palomar Street in Chula Vista, a stark reminder of the deadly consequences of illegal speed contests. The fatal crash, which occurred around 7:39 PM, involved two vehicles believed to be engaged in a ""speed contest,"" according to eyewitnesses and the Chula Vista Police Department.

Authorities report that the deceased, whose identity has not yet been released, was driving a silver Toyota Corolla when they lost control during a turn near the 1600 block of East Palomar Street. The Corolla veered off the road and collided with a palm tree, the impact so severe it split the vehicle in half. First responders and paramedics arrived swiftly at the scene, administering life-saving measures, including CPR, but the young driver succumbed to their injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The second vehicle involved, a gray Hyundai Elantra, was reportedly driven by a 28-year-old man who remained at the scene and cooperated with police. Fortunately, two small children who were passengers in the Hyundai Elantra were unharmed. Investigators have stated that neither alcohol nor drugs are believed to be factors in the crash.

The Chula Vista Police Traffic Bureau is leading the ongoing investigation to determine the official cause of the accident. While witnesses have pointed to a ""speed contest,"" the full circumstances leading to the tragedy are still under review. The incident has sent shockwaves through the community, highlighting the ongoing dangers of illicit street racing.

Residents in the area have expressed grief and concern. Adele Williams, a nearby resident who witnessed the aftermath, described it as ""something major"" and lamented the loss of life. She also noted the presence of a speed limit sign near the crash site and suggested the need for more safety measures, such as signals to alert drivers to dangerous curves.

This tragic incident underscores a persistent problem in urban areas like Chula Vista, where street racing continues despite significant risks and severe legal penalties. In California, engaging in a speed contest is a misdemeanor, punishable by jail time, substantial fines, driver's license suspension, and vehicle impoundment. If a race results in injury or death, the penalties escalate dramatically, potentially leading to felony charges and lengthy prison sentences, including ""Watson Murder"" charges in cases of vehicular homicide.

Law enforcement agencies consistently warn against the perils of street racing, emphasizing that these activities not only endanger participants but also put innocent bystanders, passengers, and other motorists at grave risk. The National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) and various traffic safety organizations have launched campaigns to educate the public on the extreme dangers associated with illegal street racing, advocating for safer alternatives at legitimate racetracks.

As the Chula Vista community mourns the loss of a young life, authorities urge anyone with additional information regarding the crash to contact the Chula Vista Police Department Traffic Bureau at 619-476-2428. This incident serves as a solemn reminder of the critical importance of responsible driving and adherence to traffic laws to prevent such preventable tragedies from occurring.",Teen driver killed in Chula Vista street race crash please use this title as your news article title and please write 500 words to finish this news,fake,1

"Purdue University Airport officially opens new Amelia Earhart Terminal with United Airlines flights.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University Airport celebrated a milestone in its aviation history Thursday with the grand opening of the new Amelia Earhart Terminal, marking the beginning of commercial passenger service through United Airlines.
The 45,000-square-foot terminal, named after the legendary aviator and Purdue alumna, welcomed its first scheduled flight at 6:30 a.m. as United Flight 2847 departed for Chicago O'Hare International Airport with 76 passengers aboard.
""Today represents a transformative moment for our university and the Greater Lafayette community,"" said Purdue President Mung Chiang during the ribbon-cutting ceremony. ""Amelia Earhart embodied the spirit of innovation and exploration that defines Purdue, and this terminal will serve as a gateway for students, faculty, and visitors to connect with opportunities around the world.""
The $28 million facility features modern amenities including four gates, enhanced security screening, a business center, and dining options operated by local vendors. The terminal's design incorporates elements honoring Earhart's legacy, including a 20-foot bronze statue in the main concourse and historical displays showcasing her time at Purdue from 1935 to 1937.
United Airlines will operate twice-daily flights to Chicago O'Hare, with additional routes to Denver and Washington Dulles planned for spring 2026. The airline's regional partner, SkyWest, will handle the West Lafayette operations using 76-seat Embraer E175 aircraft.
""We're thrilled to bring reliable air service to the Purdue community and Tippecanoe County,"" said Regional Manager Sarah Chen from United Airlines. ""This partnership reflects our commitment to connecting smaller communities with our global network.""
The airport project received funding through a combination of university resources, federal grants totaling $12 million, and private donations. Construction began in March 2023 and was completed six weeks ahead of schedule despite supply chain challenges.
Airport Director Michael Rodriguez emphasized the economic impact for the region. ""Conservative estimates suggest the new terminal will generate $15 million annually in economic activity and create approximately 120 jobs in the first three years of operation.""
The facility incorporates sustainable design features, including solar panels, LED lighting throughout, and a rainwater collection system for landscape irrigation. The terminal has achieved LEED Gold certification for environmental efficiency.
Local officials praised the development as a catalyst for business growth and tourism. West Lafayette Mayor John Dennis noted that preliminary discussions are underway with three companies considering relocating operations to the area specifically due to improved air connectivity.
For students and faculty conducting research collaborations, the new service eliminates the need for the 65-mile drive to Indianapolis International Airport. Graduate student Jennifer Liu, who frequently travels for aerospace engineering conferences, called the terminal ""a game-changer for academic mobility.""
The airport will continue operating general aviation services alongside the new commercial flights. Flight training programs through Purdue's School of Aviation and Transportation Technology will utilize the original facilities on the airport's east side.
Security and ground handling services are provided through contracts with G2 Secure Staff and Piedmont Airlines, respectively. The Transportation Security Administration has stationed four full-time officers at the facility.
Passengers can book flights through United's website or mobile app, with advance reservations recommended due to limited capacity. Parking is available in a new 300-space garage connected to the terminal via covered walkway.
The terminal officially opens to passengers Monday, August 26, with the first departure scheduled for 6:15 a.m. bound for Chicago. United expects to carry approximately 85,000 passengers annually through the West Lafayette facility.
Additional terminal improvements, including expanded gate capacity and enhanced dining options, are planned pending passenger volume growth over the next five years.","Write a full-length local news article based only on the following title.

"Purdue University Airport officially opens new Amelia Earhart Terminal with United Airlines flights.

WEST LAFAYETTE — Purdue University Airport officially opened its new Amelia Earhart Terminal Friday, marking the return of commercial flights to Chicago O'Hare after years of planning.

Flights from the newly named terminal, dedicated to the aviator who served as an advisor and counselor for women at Purdue from 1935 to 1937, are being operated by United Express.

""She was hugely successful. She inspired women not just to fly but to do things that normally women wouldn't think about doing, or they wanted some encouragement,"" Gary Lehman, Chairman of the Purdue University Board of Trustees, said.

Each flight can carry up to 50 passengers, representing a significant increase compared to previous service levels. The revival of commercial flights was driven by economic growth in the surrounding community.

""A lot of it has to do with the economic growth that our community is experiencing. The fact that we are growing at levels that are unparalleled for our area,"" said Jessica Robertson, Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Services.

Many residents of West Lafayette recall the airport's previous commercial service fondly.

""I've lived here for over 30 years so I actually have a picture of myself and my grandparents and my mom from back in the 90s flying out of the terminal,"" said Lafayette resident Nicole Cyr.

Looking ahead, Cyr shared her excitement for the future flights.

""Not having to travel that distance with three little kids now I can get them on an airplane. It's just so much more efficient and will get us off the road so I am really excited to take my kids on their first flight,"" she said.

The new flights include 11 weekly departures to O'Hare, with tickets priced around $100. Potential expansion to additional destinations is also on the horizon.

""This is just a start, so we are continuing to talk to airlines. We have some other destinations that we would like to go to and expand to, so more to come,"" Robertson added.

The project was made possible through partnerships with stakeholders such as Lilly Endowment Inc., READI, and surrounding communities.

"Edison judge faces ethics charge over lying to cops about how much he drank before crash.

A part-time Edison Municipal Court judge is facing an ethics charge over misrepresenting how much he had been drinking following a crash in South Plainfield on July 5, 2024.

Gary M. Price is also facing ethics charges for the reckless driving fine arising from the accident and for not providing a receipt from his meal at Seasons 52 in Edison before the crash.

Price has not yet filed a response to the complaint filed July 24 by the state Supreme Court Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct (ACJC).

Price, who has a private law practice in South Plainfield, was driving a 2022 Audi station wagon on Park Avenue in South Plainfield at about 6:40 p.m. July 5, 2024 when he struck a guardrail, according to court papers. No other vehicles were involved in the accident.

Police responded to an Onstar alert from Price's vehicle and saw the car against a construction barrier with damage to the front.

The South Plainfield officer saw blood on Price's clothing and his bloodshot eyes, court papers say.

When speaking to Price, who said he didn't know how the accident had happened, the officer smelled a slight odor of alcohol on Price's breath, court papers say.

Price told the officer he had consumed a martini earlier at Seasons 52, court papers say.

An ambulance was called, and the officer was unable to conduct physical field sobriety tests on Price.

However, the officer asked Price to recite the alphabet from D to W, but Price was unable to and, according to court papers, refused more alphabet tests, saying, ""the alphabet never made sense to me.""

The officer then asked him to count backwards from 55 to 43, but Price could not recall at what number he was supposed to stop, court papers say.

After being taken to the hospital, Price consented to a blood test to determine the presence of any intoxicating substance. A State Police lab test on July 14, 2024 showed a blood alcohol content of .086%, over the legal limit of .08%.

Price was charged with driving while intoxicated, reckless driving and failure to stay within marked lanes.

Because of his judgeship, the case was transferred out of Middlesex County and while he was waiting for the case to be heard, Price voluntarily applied for an ignition interlock device on his vehicle.

When the case was heard on Oct. 24, 2024, the drunken driving charge was dismissed because the defense expert's toxicology report questioned the accuracy of the blood test and the lack of physical tests at the time of the accident.

Price pleaded guilty to reckless driving and was fined $50 with no license suspension. The failure to maintain lane charge was also dismissed.

The ethics complaint alleges that Price misrepresented to the police and ACJC about how many drinks he had at Seasons 52.

Court papers say his bill at the restaurant, time-stamped a half hour before the accident, totaled $130.87, which included two Bombay Sapphire martinis, two vodka Cucumber Basil Smash drinks, an appetizer, main dish and a side dish.

The court papers also say that on each of the five previous occasions Price was at Seasons 52 in the month before the accident, his drink order included two Bombay Sapphire martinis. On two of those occasions, he had also bought additional alcoholic beverages.

In response to an inquiry from the ACJC, Price said he had one martini at the restaurant while waiting for his ""to go"" dinner to be ready. He said he was alone at the restaurant.

In a later interview with the ACJC, court papers say, Price said under oath that he had only one martini at the restaurant.

By misrepresenting how much he had consumed, the ethics complaint says, Price lacked candor ""thereby impugning the integrity of the Judiciary.""

The complaint also says that his reckless driving plea was also a violation of the state's Code of Judicial Conduct.

In addition, the ethics charge alleges that Price failed to seek and turn over his itemized receipt from Seasons 52 following a request by the ACJC. That, the charge says, violates the requirement that judges cooperate with the ACJC",https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/courts/2025/07/28/edison-nj-judge-ethics-charge-lying-to-cops-about-drinking/85375741007/,real,0
"Edison judge faces ethics charge over lying to cops about how much he drank before crash.

A prominent Edison Municipal Court judge is facing a formal ethics complaint after he allegedly lied to police officers about his alcohol consumption following a car crash last month, a crash for which he was later charged with driving under the influence.
The New Jersey Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct (ACJC) filed the complaint against Judge Robert P. Callahan on Wednesday, citing conduct that ""brings the judiciary into disrepute."" The complaint focuses not only on the underlying DUI charge but specifically on Judge Callahan’s alleged dishonesty with law enforcement at the scene.
According to the police report from the November 15th incident, Judge Callahan’s vehicle rear-ended another car at a traffic light on Route 27. When responding officers arrived, they noted the judge had slurred speech and smelled of alcohol.
When asked if he had been drinking, Judge Callahan allegedly told the officers he had consumed ""just one glass of wine with dinner"" several hours earlier.
However, a subsequent breathalyzer test administered at the police station revealed a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.14%, nearly double New Jersey's legal limit of 0.08%.
The ACJC complaint highlights this discrepancy as a serious breach of judicial ethics. “A judge’s duty to be candid and truthful is absolute, particularly when interacting with law enforcement officers performing their official duties,” the complaint reads. “Judge Callahan’s attempt to mislead officers about the extent of his impairment constitutes a grave violation of the public trust.”
The filing also made a pointed reference to the judge's demeanor during the investigation, noting what it described as a ""striking lack of remorse and a failure to accept responsibility for his actions."" An excerpt from an officer’s bodycam transcript included in the complaint quotes the judge as saying, ""This is a simple misunderstanding that is being blown out of proportion.""
Legal ethics experts say that while a DUI charge is serious for any citizen, the act of lying to police elevates the matter significantly for a judicial officer.
""The entire justice system is built on a foundation of truth,"" said a professor of legal ethics at Rutgers Law School. ""When a judge, who is expected to be an arbiter of truth, is formally accused of deception to evade personal responsibility, it erodes the very integrity of the bench.""
Judge Callahan has been suspended from his judicial duties pending the outcome of both the ethics investigation and the separate criminal proceedings for the DUI charge. His attorney, Maria Sanchez, issued a brief statement.
""Judge Callahan has served this community for over a decade,"" Sanchez said. ""He is presumed innocent and we will address these allegations through the appropriate legal channels. We ask that the public reserve judgment until all the facts are presented.""
If the ACJC finds that Judge Callahan violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, he could face penalties ranging from a private reprimand to censure, suspension, or even removal from the bench. The community of Edison now watches as a man tasked with upholding the law must answer for allegedly breaking it and then lying about it.","Generate a news article with the following title:

"A cooling market and patient buyers are causing many Pittsburgh home sellers cut their prices.

A substantial share of Pittsburgh home sellers are slashing their asking prices as the housing market cools — and buyers are taking their time, according to a new Zillow report.

More than one in four homes for sale in the Pittsburgh region saw a price cut in June, according to Zillow. Pittsburgh’s 26.8% share of listings with a price cut is slightly higher than the national record 26.6% of listings with a price cut last month. June saw the highest share of price cuts for any June since 2018, according to Zillow, a national real-estate marketplace company.

The high rate of price cuts here and across the country is a clear sign that home sellers are re-evaluating their expectations in a market no longer tilted in their favor, Zillow said.

“Sellers are still pricing their homes based on last year’s market,” said Diana McKay, a Compass Real Estate agent based in Pine. “But the market has really slowed down. I think people are waiting for interest rates to drop.” 

Pittsburgh is now among 23 of the nation’s 50 largest metro areas that Zillow labels as “neutral” markets — where neither buyers nor sellers hold the upper hand. That’s compared to just 8 markets that were neutral at this time a year ago, Zillow said.

“The shift to a ‘neutral’ market is significant, but shouldn’t be mistaken for a universally cool or easy market for buyers,” said Kara Ng, Zillow chief economist.

“While negotiating power is more balanced, the affordability crisis remains a high barrier to entry, especially for first-time buyers,” she said. “Until we see a more meaningful improvement in purchasing power, this newfound balance will primarily benefit more well-off buyers.”

Nationwide, the price cuts were most common among Sun Belt and Mountain West markets that witnessed massive appreciation early in the pandemic. Denver has the highest percentage of listing price cuts (38%), followed by Raleigh (36%), Dallas (36%), Phoenix (35%) and Nashville (35%).

In New York, where the average home value sits around $711,937, and the share of price reductions is only 15.6%, sellers are still very much in control. Other strong sellers’ markets include Milwaukee, with only 13.9% of home prices cut; and Hartford, Conn. (16%)

While home prices remain high, higher mortgage rates are what many believe are keeping a lot of would-be buyers on the sidelines. As a result, the sense of urgency that once defined house hunting has all but vanished.

Spring is typically the busiest time of year for home purchases, but home sales in June fell to a 10-month low. Meanwhile, the National Realtors Association reports that average home prices nationwide rose to a new record high of $435,300 in June, a 2% increase from a year earlier. Those record-high prices might also have made buyers more hesitant to jump into the market at those levels. In Pittsburgh, the average sales price in June hit $318,748, an increase of 5.5% from $302,137 in June 2024, according to West Penn Multi-List data.

Zillow said the high number of price cuts last month is an indication that June saw the lowest amount of buyer competition nationwide since 2018.

“Buyers have more options to choose from, more time to decide on a house and more bargaining power than in prior years,” Zillow said in its report. “Home sellers need to reach the broadest set of shoppers, price realistically and set their listing apart from the crowd.”

Compass Real estate agent Kay Barchetti, based in Bakery Square, said about half of her listings this year have had price reductions — but reductions are part of her marketing strategy.

“People love a sale,” said Ms. Barchetti who used to work in the retail industry.

“I’ll drop the price the week of an open house to draw traffic, then do slower reductions every month,” she said. “If it takes 60 to 90 days to go under contract, I know I’ve gotten the client as much as I could.”

Without a price reduction, the listing grows stale on the market, she said.

“A house will sell itself when the right person walks in the door,” Ms. Barchetti said. “My job is to bring traffic. I know that if we have a small reduction once a month, the traffic will continue.”",https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2025/07/26/pittsburgh-home-prices/stories/202507230020,real,0
"A cooling market and patient buyers are causing many Pittsburgh home sellers cut their prices.

PITTSBURGH — The red-hot housing market that once defined Pittsburgh’s post-pandemic real estate surge is showing signs of cooling — and sellers are starting to feel the chill.

Over the past three months, a growing number of home listings in Allegheny County have seen price reductions, as prospective buyers take a more cautious, wait-and-see approach. Local real estate agents report that while demand remains steady, the days of rapid bidding wars and above-asking offers are waning.

“Buyers aren’t rushing the way they used to,” said Maria DeSantis, a realtor with Keller Williams Pittsburgh North. “They’re more patient, more price-sensitive, and they're willing to wait for a deal that feels right.”

According to data from Redfin, nearly 34% of listed homes in Pittsburgh had at least one price drop in June — up from just 18% a year ago. Median sale prices have flattened, hovering around $235,000, a modest increase of 1.2% compared to this time last year.

Economists cite a mix of factors behind the trend. After years of low inventory and high demand, a surge in new listings combined with elevated interest rates has shifted the dynamic. Mortgage rates in the 6.5–7% range are keeping many buyers on the sidelines or prompting them to adjust their budgets downward.

“People are being more deliberate,” said Vincent Rowe, a housing analyst at the University of Pittsburgh. “We’re seeing the end of pandemic-era urgency and the return of negotiation power to buyers.”

Neighborhoods that once saw homes snapped up within days — like Lawrenceville, Highland Park, and Mount Washington — are now seeing properties linger longer. In some cases, sellers are cutting prices by $10,000–$30,000 to attract attention.

Still, real estate professionals urge perspective.

“This isn’t a crash — it’s a normalization,” said DeSantis. “Pittsburgh remains one of the most affordable metro markets in the U.S. The frenzy may be over, but the fundamentals are still strong.”

For buyers, the shift is welcome news. Open houses are less crowded, inspection contingencies are making a comeback, and price reductions offer new entry points into desirable neighborhoods.

“Last year we got outbid three times,” said Alex Nguyen, a first-time homebuyer in Bloomfield. “Now we finally feel like we can take our time — and maybe even negotiate a little.”

As Pittsburgh heads into the fall housing season, many in the industry expect the trend to continue — not as a downturn, but as a long-awaited rebalancing.

“It’s a cooling,” Rowe said, “not a freeze.”","Generate a news article titled ""A cooling market and patient buyers are causing many Pittsburgh home sellers cut their prices""",fake,1
"Pirates sign 2025 first-round pick Seth Hernandez.

PITTSBURGH, PA – July 22, 2025 – The Pittsburgh Pirates today officially announced the signing of their highly-touted 2025 first-round draft pick, right-handed pitcher Seth Hernandez, to a contract widely reported to be the largest signing bonus ever awarded to a non-collegiate pitcher. While terms of the deal were not officially disclosed, sources close to the organization indicate the agreement surpasses $10 million, a figure that has sent ripples of excitement and, for some, disbelief, through the baseball world.

Hernandez, an 18-year-old phenom out of Southern California, was the consensus top pitching prospect in this year's draft, lauded for his electric fastball that consistently touches 98 mph, a devastating curveball, and an advanced changeup for his age. His senior year statistics at Westview High School were nothing short of eye-popping: a 0.75 ERA with 145 strikeouts in just 60 innings pitched, alongside a .450 batting average as a two-way threat.

""We are absolutely thrilled to welcome Seth to the Pirates family,"" stated General Manager Ben Cherington at a press conference held this afternoon at PNC Park. ""Seth represents the future of this organization. His talent is undeniable, and his commitment to excellence is exactly what we look for in a player. This signing is a testament to our continued dedication to building a championship-caliber team here in Pittsburgh.""

The unprecedented signing bonus has immediately ignited speculation about the Pirates' new financial strategy. Long considered a small-market team with a conservative approach to spending, this move signals a dramatic shift. Rumors have swirled for months about a new, unannounced ownership group quietly injecting capital into the franchise, and this deal only fuels that fire.

When asked about the record-setting bonus, Cherington offered a wry smile, ""We believe in investing in elite talent. Seth is elite. It's that simple.""

Hernandez, looking poised beyond his years in a crisp Pirates jersey, expressed his enthusiasm. ""This is a dream come true. I've been working for this my entire life. I can't wait to get started and help bring a World Series title back to Pittsburgh.""

The expectation is that Hernandez will begin his professional career in the Florida Complex League, though given the significant investment, a fast track through the minor league system is widely anticipated. Pirates fans, long starved for sustained success, are abuzz with the potential of their new ace, hopeful that Seth Hernandez is the cornerstone around which a new era of winning will be built. The eyes of the baseball world will undoubtedly be on Pittsburgh as this young phenom begins his journey.","Base on the news title, generate a fake news for me.

"Pirates sign 2025 first-round pick Seth Hernandez.

The Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday signed 2025 first-round draft pick Seth Hernandez.

Hernandez, a right-handed pitcher, was the sixth overall selection of the 2025 First-Year Player Draft.

The 19-year-old was MLB Pipeline's No. 3-ranked prospect in this year's draft. Experts say the 6-foot-4, 190-pound hurler already has three elite pitches in his arsenal: a solid fastball, a changeup, and a tight curveball with spin.

""We are very excited to get the chance to work with Seth,"" said Pirates general manager Ben Cherington after the draft. ""His athleticism, velocity, ability to shape pitches and competitiveness are standout traits for a starting pitcher. He will be fun to watch develop.""

Coming into the draft, Baseball America rated Hernandez with the ""Best Changeup"" and the fourth-best ""Fastball"" among this year's high school draft class, per a media release from the Pirates.

Hernandez struck out 105 batters while recording a 0.39 ERA in his 11 appearances (11 starts) this past season for Corona High School. He also hit .319 with seven home runs and a 1.019 OPS as a senior.

Hernandez compiled an 18-1 record in his career at Corona High School while also being a two-time Los Angeles Times Player of the Year.",https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pirates-sign-2025-first-round-pick-seth-hernandez/,real,0
"The Mercedes-Benz parked downstairs was hit by a brick falling from a high altitude.

Ms. Zhang called the 85100000 hotline to report that her Mercedes-Benz was parked downstairs in her community and was hit by a brick falling from a high altitude two days ago. The property management said that the surveillance camera could not capture the specific situation and no results have been dealt with so far. Ms. Zhang was very angry: ""What would be the consequences if the brick hit someone? The surveillance camera cannot see the situation and cannot identify the perpetrator, so who should be held responsible?"" In Wangjiang Xinfengyuan, Shangcheng District, there are no parking spaces planned inside the community. Some cars are parked under trees and some are parked at the door of the unit building.

Ms. Zhang lives in Unit 1, Building 7. She said that she parked her car in the open space at the door of Unit 2, with the front of the car facing the community road and the rear of the car facing the unit building, not far from the unit door.

On the morning of July 13, her father saw a dent on the top of his car door downstairs. According to the surveillance provided by the property management, a strip of bricks fell from the sky at around 5 pm the day before (July 12), but the surveillance camera only captured the scene of the brick falling to the ground.

The reporter saw that there was an obvious dent on the roof of Ms. Zhang's car, and the scratch was 8 cm long. Ms. Zhang later called the police and handed the fallen brick to the police for investigation. From the picture, we can see that the fallen brick is long and basically matches the scratch on the roof. The surface is slightly faded and has some white patterns.

Could it be the fallen facade?

The reporter saw that the facade of Building 7 was brick-red block-shaped, with no patterns on the surface, and the shape and color were different from the fallen bricks.

Ms. Zhang said that the police also judged that it was not the fallen facade at the time, ""There are more tenants in the two units of our Building 7. Some time ago, I heard from the security guard that some owners were dismantling things at home.""

Regarding the community surveillance, the community owner group has discussed and reflected many times. An owner said that his car was scratched last summer, and he couldn't see it clearly after checking the surveillance, ""either a blind spot or not clear."" An owner of Building 6 said that the community surveillance should be updated. An owner of Building 5 said that he remembered the parking space downstairs of Building 7, where several cars were parked, and objects were thrown down from high altitude, and the rear window glass was broken...

Ms. Zhang said that someone threw cigarette butts two days ago, and a pile of things downstairs almost caught fire.

The reporter found the Xinfengyuan Property Service Center. Manager Xue of Lv'an Property said that after Ms. Zhang reported the situation, the property immediately retrieved the surveillance. Since there is no special surveillance for high-altitude objects, it is impossible to know how the brick fell, whether it was man-made or objective.

""Such things happened in the past one or two years, but we couldn't take pictures because there was no high-altitude surveillance. We were also very distressed."" Manager Xue said that on July 16, a ""warm reminder"" was posted in the corridor to remind owners to be vigilant about high-altitude objects.

Manager Xue said that this year is the third year that Lv'an Property has entered the Xinfengyuan community. This year, the contract was renewed for another three years, and the monthly property fee is less than one yuan.

""The surveillance should indeed be updated. We have already made a plan and applied for the property maintenance fund. We plan to make an overall update of the surveillance and install high-altitude cameras.""

Some owners said that they paid for parking, and the property should be responsible if the car was damaged. Ms. Zhang also raised questions: ""The 4S shop said that it would cost several thousand yuan to repair the dent. The culprit could not be found. I pay 1,200 yuan for parking every year.

"The Mercedes-Benz parked downstairs was hit by a brick falling from a high altitude.

A parked Mercedes-Benz was severely damaged in Hangzhou yesterday afternoon when a brick fell from a high-rise building, smashing into the vehicle's windshield and hood. The incident took place around 3:15 PM near a residential complex in the city’s Gongshu District, drawing immediate attention from nearby residents and raising renewed concerns over urban high-altitude safety hazards.

Eyewitness Reports Sudden Impact
According to several eyewitnesses, the luxury car had been parked in a designated spot along the side of the residential tower for less than 10 minutes when the brick came crashing down from above. “I heard a loud bang like something exploded,” said Ms. Wang, a shop owner across the street. “When I rushed out, I saw the brick lodged in the broken windshield. The car alarm was blaring.”

Residents of the building quickly gathered at the scene, shocked by the randomness—and potential danger—of the event. Fortunately, no one was inside or near the vehicle when the brick struck.

No Injuries, But Major Property Damage
The owner of the Mercedes-Benz, Mr. Liu, a 38-year-old local entrepreneur, expressed both relief and frustration. “Thank goodness no one got hurt. But this is not just a scratch—it’s thousands in damage. Who's going to be responsible for this?”

Photos from the scene show a large, reddish brick—likely from the building’s exterior façade—embedded in the car’s shattered windshield, with dents along the front hood. Maintenance workers cordoned off the area shortly after the incident.

Authorities Investigate Building Maintenance
Hangzhou police and urban management authorities are currently investigating the source of the falling brick. Preliminary inspections suggest that it may have come loose from the upper floors of the residential complex due to aging materials and recent heavy rainfall, which weakened external structures.

A spokesperson from the property management company stated that they were “deeply concerned” about the incident and had initiated an emergency safety check across the building. “We are cooperating fully with the investigation and will ensure that any loose materials are promptly repaired or removed.”

Growing Concern Over High-Altitude Falling Objects
This incident is the latest in a growing number of cases in urban China where objects falling from buildings—often referred to as “high-altitude projectiles”—have caused damage or injury. In many cities, these occurrences have sparked legal debates over liability and calls for stricter enforcement of building maintenance standards.

Under Chinese civil law, when an object falls from a building and the responsible party cannot be determined, all residents of that building could be held jointly liable unless proven otherwise.

Community Urges Swift Action
Residents are urging the property management to conduct a thorough safety audit. Some have even begun discussing the installation of protective awnings over the parking areas and increasing surveillance to deter both negligence and potential intentional acts.

“This is not just about a car,” said Ms. Zhou, a mother of two who lives on the 12th floor. “Next time, it could be someone walking by. We need to feel safe in our own neighborhood.”

As the investigation continues, Mr. Liu said he plans to seek compensation for the damages, either from the property management or through legal channels. Meanwhile, city officials have reminded building owners and managers across Hangzhou to conduct immediate safety inspections in light of recent weather conditions and ensure no similar hazards remain undetected.",generate an article titled with 'The Mercedes-Benz parked downstairs was hit by a brick falling from a high altitude' the news happens in hangzhou,fake,1
"More than 40,000 people in Pittsburgh had their medical debt erased. Here's who qualified..

**More than 40,000 people in Pittsburgh had their medical debt erased. Here's who qualified.**

*Byline: PITTSBURGH, PA — July 29, 2025*

In a sweeping act of financial and moral relief, over 40,000 residents of Pittsburgh recently had their medical debt wiped clean, thanks to a collaboration between the nonprofit ClearHope and a coalition of local hospitals, faith groups, and donors. The total amount erased? A staggering \$72.4 million.

### Who Qualified?

The forgiveness wasn't arbitrary. To be eligible, individuals needed to meet specific criteria:

* **Income below 400% of the federal poverty level** (roughly \$60,240 for an individual or \$125,000 for a family of four)
* **Medical debt that exceeded 5% of annual household income**
* **Debt incurred at participating local hospitals** including UPMC Presbyterian, Allegheny General, and Mercy

ClearHope purchased bundled portfolios of delinquent medical debt on the secondary market — often for pennies on the dollar — and then used philanthropic funds to eliminate the obligations. Importantly, recipients did not need to apply; the forgiveness was automatic, and notifications were mailed in yellow envelopes that read simply, “This debt is no longer yours.”

### “A Letter I Never Expected”

For Michelle Ramsey, a single mother of two in the Hill District, the letter came as a shock. “I thought it was another collection notice,” she said. “But when I opened it, I just started crying. It said my \$11,347 in debt was gone. I called my mom in disbelief.”

Michelle is one of thousands of Pittsburghers who delayed care due to unpaid bills or faced mounting anxiety over calls from collectors. “Now, I can take my son to his asthma specialist without worrying we’ll get sent to collections,” she added.

### A Ripple Effect Beyond Finances

While medical debt relief may seem financial in nature, its effects are also deeply emotional. “We heard from dozens of patients who hadn’t seen a doctor in years out of fear,” said Rev. James Parker of Grace Cathedral, a partner in the initiative. “This program is about restoring dignity.”

Local credit counselors also report that some beneficiaries have seen increases in their credit scores. Though medical debt under \$500 no longer factors into most FICO scores as of 2023, the emotional burden and administrative challenges remained until now.

### What’s Next?

Mayor Ed Gainey has praised the program and hinted at broader initiatives. “No one should have to choose between rent and cancer treatment,” he said at a press conference on Tuesday. “This is a model not just for Pittsburgh, but for the country.”

ClearHope’s next target? An estimated 19,000 individuals in the Mon Valley area, with another \$32 million in medical debt set to be reviewed for forgiveness later this year.

"More than 40,000 people in Pittsburgh had their medical debt erased. Here's who qualified..

More than 40,000 people in Pittsburgh will soon learn their medical debt has been erased.

Pittsburgh City Councilman Bobby Wilson said more than 43,000 Pittsburgh residents have had $58 million in medical debt cleared thanks to the city's partnership with Undue Medical Debt, a non-profit organization in Boston that works to end medical debt. The organization said it has helped relieve more than $20.3 billion in medical debt. 

$58 million in medical debt erased in Pittsburgh 
Wilson said in a news release on Monday that ""this milestone"" comes after legislation that authorized Pittsburgh to contract with Undue Medical Debt to identify and erase qualifying medical debt held by city residents. 

""I'm thrilled to partner with the City of Pittsburgh on this transformative medical debt relief initiative that will bring much-needed good news to thousands of residents,"" Undue Medical Debt President and CEO Allison Sesso said in Wilson's news release. ""Medical debt is both a financial and emotional burden that forces families to make difficult decisions and often prevents patients from getting the care they need.""

Who qualifies for the debt relief in Pittsburgh? 
To qualify, Pittsburgh residents had to have a household income no higher than 400% of the federal poverty level or have medical debt equal to 5% of their annual income. 

There was no application process, as qualified residents were found through hospitals, health care providers and debt collectors.

Residents who qualified will automatically receive a branded letter from Undue Medical Debt identifying which of their debts was erased. Letters will begin arriving this week. 

""No one should be burdened simply because they got sick. Relieving this debt will have a significant impact on the lives of many Pittsburghers,"" Wilson said in the news release. ",https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/medical-debt-erased-pittsburgh/,real,0
"Explosion Sound Heard Yesterday at Douliu Circular Road in Yunlin - Public Startled Near Bank! Broken Debris Found at Scene.

Good evening, I'm reporting live from Douliu City in Yunlin County, where residents were startled yesterday by what witnesses described as a loud explosion near a bank on Circular Road.

"Music business students develop Gen Z marketing campaigns for Loveland record label.

Loveland, OH — A group of music business students is helping a local record label break new ground with creative marketing strategies tailored to Gen Z audiences.

The collaboration, part of a semester-long course project, paired students with Loveland-based indie label Riverbend Records to design campaigns that speak directly to younger music consumers. Students researched audience behavior, analyzed social media trends, and created promotional concepts that blend music, lifestyle, and digital engagement.

“Our goal was to give students hands-on experience with the realities of today’s music industry while also providing our label with fresh ideas,” said Professor Amanda Lewis, who oversees the music business program at Loveland University. “Gen Z has unique expectations when it comes to authenticity and how they discover artists, and the students rose to that challenge.”

Campaign proposals included TikTok-driven teaser strategies, merchandise collaborations with local visual artists, and interactive livestream events designed to showcase Riverbend’s emerging roster. One team pitched a digital street-team concept that recruits fans as brand ambassadors in exchange for exclusive behind-the-scenes content.

Riverbend Records founder James Callahan said the student work exceeded expectations. “They didn’t just tell us what Gen Z wants — they showed us,” Callahan said. “The campaigns are smart, bold, and rooted in the platforms where younger listeners actually spend their time.”

Students will present their final proposals in a public showcase next month, where Riverbend plans to select one or more campaigns for real-world rollout.

For junior Sofia Ramirez, the project offered a glimpse into her dream career. “We weren’t just studying the industry, we were part of it,” Ramirez said. “Knowing our work could actually shape an artist’s success is an incredible motivator.”

The initiative underscores both Loveland University’s commitment to experiential learning and Riverbend Records’ interest in cultivating fresh voices in music promotion.",Write a realistic news article based on the title Music business students develop Gen Z marketing campaigns for Loveland record label.,fake,1
"Music business students develop Gen Z marketing campaigns for Loveland record label.


 

Loveland, Ohio – What does it take to launch a successful album? A lot of talent, even more luck, and the right team of in-the-know marketers, like the students in Miami’s music business courses.

Across two classes – Intro to Music Business and Record Labels and Music Publishing Operations – students in Willie Caldwell’s lectures learn the ins and outs of the music industry while working directly with label executives.

The collaboration began when Caldwell, an adjunct instructor in Arts Management and Arts Entrepreneurship, was researching the regional music scene to learn more about the local music venues and record labels. Terry Cole’s name stood out in his search.

Cole is the founder of Colemine Records, which is housed above the label’s shop, Plaid Room Records in Historic Downtown Loveland, Ohio. As the story goes, he cooked up the idea for Colemine Records in 2007 and drew the logo on the back of a Subway napkin right here in Oxford – while he was a graduate student at Miami.

Together, Colemine executives and Caldwell workshopped a collaboration. Cole visited one of Caldwell’s classes to guest lecture on the industry, which Caldwell said was very well received by his student, but they had sights on a bigger partnership.

“They were interested in better understanding Gen Z’s new music discovery habits,” Caldwell said. “So what if we target the Miami student population? How do they discover new music? Where’s it coming from? What are their listening habits?”

Caldwell and his class generated a survey that was sent out campus-wide before students left for spring break. They received over 300 responses in just two weeks’ time and ended up with a solid pool of data for further research.
Kendra Morris

With that baseline, the class could use the data to inform their next stage in the Colemine Records collaboration. The students were charged with creating an artist release campaign that would engage Gen Z listeners for the launch of artist Kendra Morris’ upcoming album.

The students had the opportunity to interview Morris to learn more about her and her artistic style, and then they combined that information with the survey results to build out their projects.

“It’s just a really cool opportunity where we were able to connect with the largest independent label out of Southwest Ohio and get access to a signed artist that is underneath them,” Caldwell said. “(Students) got to put their creativity to work and actually come up with some campaign ideas for her release.”

The entire collaboration culminated in a visit from the Colemine Records executive team, which led a panel for music industry questions. As part of their final exam for the class, the student groups set their campaign pitches to Colemine Records.

Morris and Colemine Records executives latched on to student-generated ideas circling around social media livestream and broadcasting features that would help promote Morris’ upcoming release.

“We absolutely loved this collaboration and continue to explore possibilities for future engagements between the Arts Management and Arts Entrepreneurship program and Colemine Records,” Caldwell said.

For Ian Dilenschneider, this collaboration was one of his last hurdles to graduate with a degree in Music Technology – one he’s glad he got to be involved with.

“As a graduating senior hoping to go into the music industry – especially the indie scene – it was immensely helpful to have this opportunity,” Dilenschneider said. “The chance to talk to the label felt like I was taking my first steps as a professional artist.”
Terry Cole

Working with Colemine Records executives on this project pushed the course beyond the norm of textbook work, according to senior music technology major Isa Riddle. She said she was truly inspired by the executives when they spoke to her class.

“I couldn’t be more grateful for the opportunity,” Riddle said. “As someone who wants to pursue a career in the music industry, all of the work we’ve done has helped me build confidence in myself to start enacting some of my plans!”

With the success of the project, the Arts Management and Arts Entrepreneurship program plans to continue working with Colemine Records in the fall and will be introducing a new course, Live Music and Touring, alongside Intro to Music Business and Record Labels and Music Publishing Operations.
