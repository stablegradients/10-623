"Yuyuan Garden Night Tour Launches for the First Time.

Shanghai's iconic Yuyuan Garden has officially opened its doors to evening visitors for the first time in its centuries-long history, marking a groundbreaking expansion of one of China's most treasured cultural landmarks.

The historic Ming Dynasty garden, renowned for its classical Chinese architecture and meticulously designed landscapes, will now welcome guests during nighttime hours with specially curated illumination that highlights the garden's pavilions, rockeries, and tranquil ponds. The new night tour program transforms the traditional daytime experience into an enchanting after-dark journey through one of Shanghai's most significant cultural sites.

Visitors can now experience the garden's famous Dragon Wall, the Sansui Hall, and the picturesque zigzag bridge under carefully designed lighting that preserves the site's historical authenticity while creating a magical atmosphere. The illumination system has been thoughtfully installed to complement the garden's traditional aesthetics without compromising its cultural integrity.

The night tours operate with limited capacity to ensure an intimate and peaceful experience, allowing guests to appreciate the garden's beauty in a completely new setting. Traditional Chinese lanterns and subtle LED lighting work together to create shadows and reflections that bring new life to the 400-year-old garden's architectural elements.

This historic launch represents a significant development in Shanghai's cultural tourism offerings, providing both residents and international visitors with an unprecedented opportunity to experience one of China's finest classical gardens in an entirely new light. The night tour program is expected to become a major attraction for those seeking a unique cultural experience in the heart of Shanghai's old city.",help me to compose a news titled as Yuyuan Garden Night Tour Launches for the First Time do not ask for more info write the news directly!,fake,1
"Yuyuan Garden Night Tour Launches for the First Time.

Shanghai's summer nights come alive after dark. Tonight, the Yuyuan Garden Night Tour, themed “Enjoying the Mountain Forest,” officially unveils its regular experience. As one of the quintessential classical gardens of Jiangnan, this “urban mountain forest” built in 1559 now takes on a new vitality through the interplay of tradition and modernity, using the night sky as its canvas and light as its brush. For every visitor, this timeless garden journey through the night has become an essential stop to experience the quintessential cultural essence of Shanghai.

“Night Narratives” Reveal the “Cultural Soul”

After a year of preparation, the Yuyuan Garden night tour weaves a complete narrative thread centered on the core imagery of “water.” From the rippling pond before Yangshan Hall to the starlight-like springs beside the Jade Pavilion, the fluidity of water runs through five thematic sections, connecting 24 distinctive landscapes. As visitors traverse the 350-meter route, they journey through a temporal tunnel, touching the historical fabric of Jiangnan gardens amidst light and shadow.

Light shows at five core sites—Grand Rockery, Wisteria Deep, Ten Thousand Flowers Pavilion, Nine Lions Pavilion, and Jade Pavilion—serve as the tour's crowning touch. The garden's crown jewel, the Jade Pavilion, serves as the soul of the night tour. Through the ingenious interplay of lights and mist, the marvel of “smoke rising from every pore, springs flowing from every pore” is reborn. Here, visitors can appreciate the “cosmos within a stone” philosophy of Taihu stone landscaping while connecting with the Song Dynasty literati's spirit of “finding solace in nature.”

The night tour also achieves a cross-disciplinary fusion of “garden” and “museum.” Selected masterpieces from Yuyuan's collection of paintings and calligraphy are brought to life through digital multimedia technology: in the left section of the central scroll in Sansui Hall, Tang Luming's late Qing dynasty “Ladies Admiring Plum Blossoms” depicts a lady leaning by the window, gazing across the void at the viewer. As the project's curator noted: “Daytime visits to Yuyuan Garden reveal its ‘landscaped beauty’; nighttime explorations unveil its ‘cultural soul’.”

Small-Group Custom Tours: Savoring Beauty at a Leisurely Pace

As a cultural tourism landmark in Shanghai, Yuyuan Garden welcomed over 2.7 million visitors in 2024, with foreign tourists accounting for nearly a quarter of the total. How to convert “traffic” into ‘retention’? The night tour program offers an innovative solution—centered on “small-group customized guided tours” to create an immersive “slow down” experience.

Unlike the daytime bustle, the night tour adopts a “small group of about 20 people + professional guide” model, with each group entering the park at 10-minute intervals. During the 50-minute tour, guides serve not only as navigators but as cultural interpreters: explaining the “Flower and Stone Cargo” and Northern Song Dynasty history before the Jade Linglong Pavilion, and introducing the literati social tradition of “floating cups on winding streams” beside the Nine Lions Pavilion. For international visitors, Yuyuan Garden has partnered with the School of Advanced Translation at Shanghai International Studies University to elevate multilingual tours into “cultural interpretations.” Concurrently, streamlined entry procedures and expanded multilingual guide systems enhance the visitor experience for global guests.

Night tours operate during summer and autumn (May–October) on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from 6:30 PM to 9:50 PM; Winter and spring season (January–April, November–December): Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from 6:00 PM to 9:20 PM. This staggered operation ensures visitor comfort while minimizing impact on garden vegetation and architecture, achieving a balance between conservation and utilization.",https://paper.xinmin.cn/html/xmwb/2025-08-08/3/218134.html,real,0
"Millvale business shares warning after being target of electric bill scam.

Millvale business shares warning after being target of electric bill scam

A Millvale bakery is urging fellow small businesses to be on guard after nearly handing over hundreds of dollars to scammers posing as their electric utility late last week.

Riverfront Bakeshop owner Jenna Morales said she was prepping for the Friday lunch rush when a caller claiming to be from “Duquesne Electric Services” said her account was “in immediate shutoff status” over an alleged past-due balance.

“They knew our account number and yesterday’s meter reading. It sounded official—until they demanded a prepaid cash card in the next 30 minutes,” Morales told the Millvale Herald.

Morales says the caller spoofed the utility’s main phone number and forwarded her to a “billing supervisor” who stayed on the line while she walked to a nearby pharmacy to buy a $498 MoneyPak card. A clerk overheard the conversation and warned her it was a common scam.

“I felt embarrassed, but mostly angry. If that cashier hadn’t spoken up, I would’ve been out five hundred bucks,” she said.

Pattern hits Western Pa.
Millvale police confirmed they’ve received three similar reports from local shops this month. Detective Sean Krupa said the hallmarks are the same: urgent shutoff threat, immediate payment via gift or reloadable cards, and instructions not to hang up.

“These crooks use fear and a ticking clock. Legitimate utilities don’t demand payment that way,” Krupa said.

Duquesne Light Company spokesperson Erin Beck reiterated that the company never requests payment via prepaid cards, cryptocurrency or wire transfer. “We send multiple written notices before any disconnection. If you’re unsure, hang up and call us directly using the number on your bill,” Beck said.

How to spot the scam
Pressure + deadline: “Pay in 30 minutes or we cut power.” Real utilities follow regulated shutoff timelines.

Weird payment methods: Gift cards, MoneyPak, Zelle to a personal email = red flag.

Caller won’t let you hang up: They fear you’ll verify the story.

Spoofed caller ID: Tech makes it easy to mimic a real number—trust the message, not the screen.

Personal info already in hand: Scammers buy or phish account data to sound legitimate.

What to do
Hang up. Call the utility using the official number on a statement or website.

Report it. Notify local police and the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.

Warn staff. Train employees who answer phones about the script scammers use.

Post a notice. A simple sign by the register can stop a scam in progress.

Morales has taped a bright orange flyer near her register that reads: “WE WILL NEVER PAY BILLS BY GIFT CARD—SCAM ALERT!” She’s also sharing her story on neighborhood Facebook groups.

“If this saves one other business from getting burned, it’s worth the embarrassment,” she said.

"Millvale business shares warning after being target of electric bill scam.

A Millvale business has a warning for others after it was the target of an electricity scam.

It was the middle of the Wednesday rush at Compass Point Coffee in Millvale when owner Eric Hodos said he got a call from someone claiming to be from Duquesne Light.

""At that moment, I was like, oh, we have to solve this because they come and turn our power off, we're going to lose revenue for the next couple of days,"" said Hodos.

Hodos said the person on the phone told him he owed nearly $2,000 and crews were coming to shut off service unless the remaining balance was paid immediately. He then called his business partner. 

""I said, look, we're on it. She is calling the billing department right now. He says here's the number, have her call this number. So, she called that number, and they answered with Duquesne Light.""

But something still didn't seem right. She checked the electric bill and told Hodos they were even; no money was owed. He called the number back and asked to speak to a manager.

That is when the scheme was uncovered. 

""He said I'll transfer you to my manager, and when it went there, it was some random, it was like you've reached John,"" Hodos said.

KDKA called both numbers. The one for billing was disconnected, and the other went to a Phoenix-based bus company.

Hodos said he's heard of another Millave business experiencing the same thing.

""We want to make sure people don't fall prey to this,"" he said. ""It sounded very legitimate. It sounded very real. They [prey] on your fears, and they want you to react.""

Duquesne Light encourages people to always check their bill first and call it directly. The company said that before the power is shut off, multiple notices are sent.

"City leans on once-controversial zoning tool for new housing proposals.

In a move that has reignited debate over urban development, city officials are turning to a formerly contentious zoning mechanism to pave the way for new housing construction amid mounting pressure to address affordability and supply.

The tool, known as “upzoning by overlay,” allows city planners to bypass traditional zoning restrictions in targeted areas, enabling developers to build taller, denser residential buildings than would typically be allowed. Once criticized for accelerating gentrification and overdevelopment, the approach is now being rebranded as a strategic solution to the city's deepening housing crisis.

“We’re not the same city we were ten years ago,” said Planning Commissioner Maria Esposito at Tuesday’s public hearing. “Our population has grown, housing prices have soared, and we have to be bold if we want to keep this city livable for working families.”

The proposed zoning overlay would impact six neighborhoods—three near transit hubs and three in formerly industrial zones—allowing for apartment complexes of up to eight stories where the current limit is four. City planners estimate this could create more than 12,000 new housing units over the next decade, a quarter of which would be designated as affordable.

While some longtime critics of the zoning tool remain skeptical, others who once opposed it are now cautiously supportive, citing new safeguards and affordability requirements.

“We fought against these overlays when they were being used to bulldoze communities,” said Melinda James, director of the Eastside Neighborhood Alliance. “But this time, it looks like there’s a serious effort to center equity and ensure that longtime residents benefit from the growth.”

Developers have welcomed the shift, calling it a step toward modernizing outdated land-use laws. “It gives us a clearer, faster path to build housing where people want to live,” said Amir Desai, CEO of Horizon Urban. “And the inclusionary requirements strike a reasonable balance.”

Still, some homeowners and preservationists warn of unintended consequences, including increased traffic congestion, strain on infrastructure, and the loss of neighborhood character.

“The city seems to be saying ‘build at any cost,’” said Lindsay Harper, a vocal opponent from the Historic Preservation Society. “But we have to ask: cost to whom?”

Public comment on the proposal remains open for the next 45 days. The City Council is expected to vote on the plan in late September. If approved, the zoning overlays would take effect in early 2026.",generate a news article with this title: City leans on once-controversial zoning tool for new housing proposals,fake,1
"City leans on once-controversial zoning tool for new housing proposals.

Palo Alto City Council will review on Aug. 11 two housing proposals that are trying to use a historically contentious rezoning process to build denser housing downtown and along El Camino Real. 

The Planned Home Zoning (PHZ) process allows developers to petition the city to rezone a site for denser housing than would otherwise be allowed, so long as 20% of the units are set aside for low-income households.

The two residential proposals at 4256 El Camino Real and 332 Forest Ave. reflect a remarkable turnaround for a Palo Alto zoning mechanism that fell out of favor a decade ago, shortly after voters rejected a “planned community” zone change that would have facilitated the construction of a 60-apartment complex for low-income seniors on Maybell Avenue. The following year, the City Council agreed not to use the process anymore, citing public disillusion with it.

The planned-community process remained on hiatus until 2020, when the city brought it back under the name “planned home zoning.” Much like PC projects, proposals under the new designation are allowed to exceed development standards in exchange for public benefits. But whereas the former process made room for a wide variety of benefits, including sculptures, public plazas and grocery stores, the revived process pertains only to housing.

4256 El Camino Real

The six-story project at 4256 El Camino Real includes 120 units, an increase of 20 units from the original proposal. The project applicant said the change is “necessary to address the increasing financial burden of development” because the previous plan for just 100 units would not be dense enough to make the project financially feasible. Only 18 of the 120 units are for low-income households, but because one of those units is for very-low income residents, the weighted percentage of below-market-rate units comes out to just over 20%, according to the project plans.

“Our proposal strikes a balance — achieving the minimum density required for viability while respecting the corridor’s zoning and the City’s broader housing objectives,” applicant Mircea Voskerician wrote in a June 13 letter to the Planning Department.

Voskerician added that they secured a parking arrangement with an adjacent property to maintain the same 1:1 parking spot to housing unit ratio as the original application.

To make the project compliant with zoning regulations, the city would have to increase height and density limits, waive the requirement for retail on site and reduce parking spot and open space requirements. The project also deviates from a number of objective design standards such as landscaping requirements.

The site at 4256 El Camino Real, which formerly housed the restaurant Su Hong, was not identified for housing in the city’s Housing Element, a document that lists sites where the city’s planning for housing. The document’s housing inventory aims to meet the city’s state-manded goal of adding 6,086 units by 2031. That means that any units would increase the city’s buffer for new housing, as determined by the Regional Housing Needs Allocation process, city staff wrote in a report to the council. 

The project is not without complaints from neighbors, though. The site at 4256 El Camino Real is adjacent to the Palo Alto Redwoods condominiums, and residents of the four-story complex are concerned about privacy and traffic with the addition of 120 units next door. Many people who wrote complaints to the council suggested that the overall quality of life for nearby residents would decline with the approval of the project.

“I ask you to think of the idea of a 90 foot tall wall of windows and balconies blocking all light and views of the sky from your property. I ask you to imagine the invasion of privacy that would entail. Never being able to see outside without other people staring back at you,” wrote Anne Mason, a Palo Alto Redwoods resident.

The proposal is for a 79-foot-6-inch building—with mechanical rooftop equipment that extends the height to 91 feet.

In 2020, the city approved Voskerician’s application for a five-story hotel project at the same site, which would have included 96 rooms. But in a March 26 letter to the council, the developer wrote that a residential building with long-term residents would “better integrate with neighboring residential properties,” citing neighbors’ concerns about noise, traffic and privacy.

332 Forest Ave.

The proposal for 332 Forest Ave. would bring 82 units to a downtown site. Rendering by Steinberg Hart/city of Palo Alto
The project at 332 Forest Ave. in downtown Palo Alto is for an eight-story building with 82 units, 16 of which are set aside for low-income households. 

Like with the proposal on El Camino Real, the city would need to exempt the project from several zoning standards, including density, building height, daylight planes and bicycle parking. And like the other proposal, 332 Forest Ave. was not identified for housing in the city’s most recent Housing Element.

“Although Forest Commons was not specifically listed as an opportunity site, its realization would by itself contribute nearly one-quarter of the total housing units targeted for the downtown area, which is the most transit-oriented and pedestrian-friendly of all districts,” the developer wrote in a May 16 letter.

There is currently a 16-unit apartment complex at the site, which would have to be demolished if the new project is approved in the future. The existing structure, which was built in 1925, appears eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, according to a city staff report. But the developer supplied a Historical Resources Evaluation from 2004 indicating that it would not be eligible for a historic designation.

The developer added in the May 16 letter that the existing building occupies “a mere 27% of the lot” which leaves “a significant portion of land in Palo Alto’s urban core underutilized.”

The council will not be taking any action to approve or reject the two projects Monday night. Instead, the prescreening process works to solicit early feedback ahead of a formal application.

"Flood alert in Varanasi as Ganga in spate, ghats submerged.

VARANASI, July 22 - The holy city of Varanasi is grappling with severe flooding as the Ganga River has risen to dangerous levels, submerging several of the city's iconic ghats and prompting authorities to issue flood alerts across the region.
The sacred riverfront, which serves as the spiritual heart of one of India's oldest cities, has witnessed unprecedented water levels following days of heavy monsoon rainfall upstream. The rising waters have inundated the stone steps of multiple ghats, disrupting the daily religious rituals and ceremonies that draw thousands of pilgrims and devotees to the ancient city.
Among the most severely affected is the famous Dashashwamedh Ghat, where the evening Ganga Aarti ceremony has been relocated to higher ground. The Manikarnika Ghat, traditionally used for cremation ceremonies, has also been partially submerged, forcing funeral rites to be conducted from elevated platforms or nearby lanes.
Local administration officials have activated emergency protocols and deployed rescue teams along the riverfront. Boat services have been temporarily suspended due to strong currents, while several low-lying residential areas near the ghats have been evacuated as a precautionary measure.
""The water level is rising steadily, and we are monitoring the situation round the clock,"" said a district magistrate spokesperson. ""All necessary arrangements for relief and rehabilitation have been put in place.""
The flooding has significantly impacted the city's tourism sector, with many hotels and guesthouses along the riverfront experiencing waterlogging. Street vendors and shop owners near the ghats have been forced to relocate their goods to safer locations.
The India Meteorological Department has forecast continued rainfall in the region over the next 48 hours, raising concerns that water levels could rise further. Authorities have advised residents in flood-prone areas to remain vigilant and follow evacuation orders if issued.
The Ganga's rising waters have also affected river transportation, with ferry services suspended between Varanasi and neighboring areas. Emergency shelters have been set up in schools and community centers for displaced families.
This latest flood episode underscores the recurring challenge Varanasi faces during monsoon season, when the combination of heavy rainfall and upstream water flow regularly threatens the ancient city's riverside communities and sacred spaces.
Local meteorologists expect the situation to stabilize once rainfall intensity decreases, though residents and pilgrims are advised to exercise caution when visiting the ghat areas until water levels recede to normal levels.","generate a news article based on this title  ""Flood alert in Varanasi as Ganga in spate, ghats submerged""

"Bellevue library offers pet microchip scanners to reunite lost pets with owners.

BELLEVUE, Neb. (KMTV)– ""When someone finds a lost pet, you don't know what to do, and it allows people to have a little bit of control in the situation,"" Laura Mischke, head of Adult Services said.

Bellevue library now offers pet microchip scanners.
Neighbors have to hold a valid Bellevue library card to check the scanners out.
If you do not have a card, you can bring the pet to the library to get it scanned.

When Laura Mischke, head of Adult Services at the Bellevue Public Library, lost her dog Darwin, he was able to be brought back home safely due to his microchip. ""I was contacted at work by a vet who said he had your dog, and it was because of a microchip, so it does work,"" Mischke said.

According to Mischke, after seeing numerous posts on social media about neighbors finding lost dogs, the library staff had an idea.

They got microchip scanners.

""There's a power button on the back, so you press that and then it's ready to scan,"" she said.

All to help those who find wandering pets... and those searching for them. ""It's a way really to reunite lost pets with their owner, a little bit of peace of mind, and when someone finds a lost pet, you don't know what to do, and it allows people to have a little bit of control in the situation and actively do something rather than posting it on Facebook,"" Mischke said.

Neighbors will scan for a microchip and receive a number to type into the website. The microchip company will contact the owner of the lost pet to help get them home.

Although the scanner is only available to check out to library card owners, neighbors without a card can bring lost pets to the library, and they will scan for a microchip, according to Mischke.

"Bellevue library offers pet microchip scanners to reunite lost pets with owners.

BELLEVUE, WA — July 22, 2025 — What began as a wholesome initiative to reunite pets with their owners took a bizarre turn at the Bellevue Public Library this week, after overzealous patrons accidentally began scanning librarians and other library-goers with the new pet microchip scanners.

The library’s program, intended to allow residents to borrow handheld scanners to help return stray pets, was launched Monday to community praise. But confusion arose when an instructional pamphlet labeled ""Scan everything for peace of mind"" was taken a bit too literally.

“I was scanning my cat, but then I thought—what if Susan from Reference is chipped?” said local patron Greg Harkins. “Next thing I know, it beeps and shows ‘Property of Area 51 – Subject #0419’. I knew it!”

Several staff members were momentarily alarmed to find that their employee ID cards, fitness trackers, and even dental fillings were setting off scanner alerts. One unsuspecting teenager was allegedly registered as a “Persian tabby, neutered, last seen in Boise.”

Library Director Laura Mischke quickly clarified, “No, we are not all secretly pets. And yes, please stop trying to scan the barista at the café.”

Despite the hiccups, the program has already helped reunite six dogs, four cats, and one very confused rabbit with their owners. Mischke says next month they plan to launch a “Scan Your Plant” initiative in partnership with a local nursery—though they promise this one comes with better signage.","generate fake news base on this title:

"A letter from a university to a student who was not admitted sparked heated discussion. The president responded: It was not a ""notice of rejection"", but just a message of encouragement.

A heartfelt letter sent by a prestigious university to a student who was not admitted has gone viral on social media, igniting public debate over the boundaries between compassion and formality in higher education communications.

The letter, which surfaced on Monday, was addressed to a high school senior who had applied to the university's competitive undergraduate program but was ultimately not selected. Unlike standard rejection emails, the letter expressed empathy and admiration for the student’s accomplishments and encouraged them to continue pursuing their goals with confidence.

“Your application demonstrated great promise. Although we are unable to offer you admission at this time, we want you to know that your story moved us, and we believe your future is bright,” the letter read.

The message, initially praised for its warmth, quickly drew polarized reactions online. Some praised the university for its human touch, saying it reflected a much-needed shift away from impersonal bureaucratic rejection letters. Others criticized the letter as emotionally misleading, suggesting it offered false hope or blurred the lines of clear communication.

Amid growing speculation and commentary, the university's president, Dr. Elaine Matthews, issued a public statement Tuesday to clarify the intent behind the letter.

“This was not a formal ‘notice of rejection’,” Dr. Matthews said. “It was a personal message of encouragement. We understand how emotionally challenging the admissions process can be, and our goal was simply to acknowledge the effort and courage it takes to apply.”

Dr. Matthews emphasized that such letters were rare and reserved for exceptional applicants whose stories resonated with admissions officers. “We believe in recognizing effort and character—not just outcomes,” she added.

Still, the debate highlights a broader tension in university admissions: how to maintain empathy while delivering decisions that inevitably carry disappointment. Critics argue that too much emotional nuance risks confusion, especially for first-generation applicants unfamiliar with college admissions language.

But for the student at the center of the discussion, the letter was a source of strength. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), they wrote: “I didn’t get in, and that hurts—but this letter reminded me that someone saw me. That matters.”

The university has since reiterated its commitment to transparency and compassion, stating that it would review its admissions communications moving forward.

"A letter from a university to a student who was not admitted sparked heated discussion. The president responded: It was not a ""notice of rejection"", but just a message of encouragement.

After the college entrance examination, many candidates eagerly 'show off' their acceptance letters. Recently, several netizens shared a letter from Xu Yangsheng, the president of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), addressed to students who were not admitted, along with a small gift sent by the school, which has attracted attention. In response, some netizens found this gesture heartwarming, while others questioned it as 'rubbing salt in the wound.' On July 28, Xu Yangsheng told Hongxing News that this is not an 'unadmission letter'; it is mainly intended to encourage young people who are currently under a lot of pressure. The current version of the 'letter to students who were not admitted' was personally written by Xu Yangsheng in 2020. Picture source: WeChat account of 'The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.' 'Every year, I send such a letter to students who were not admitted, mainly to encourage them,' Xu Yangsheng stated. 'Young people today are indeed under a lot of pressure, so we must show more care and encouragement to those who have many anxieties and pressures.' The admissions office of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) begins the letter by conveying President Xu Yangsheng's deep concern and sincere message, thanking the student for their efforts and perseverance in pursuing their dreams, and hoping that this letter can alleviate some disappointment and provide strength for the future, wishing to bring warmth and companionship. 'I fully understand your feelings at this moment. Indeed, I also feel very sorry...' In the letter, Xu Yangsheng shared a story about a friend of his and his own, stating that the road of life is very long, and the college entrance examination is not as important as students may think it is right now. 'Your setbacks today will be the guiding light on your path to progress tomorrow. Although today you passed by your desired university, as long as you are an excellent person, you can succeed anywhere, you will be a hero wherever you go, and you will achieve success wherever you are!'

"Passengers evacuate Delta flight on slides after aborted takeoff in snowy Atlanta.

ATLANTA — A Delta Airlines flight was forced to abort its takeoff at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Tuesday morning due to weather-related issues, leading passengers to evacuate the aircraft via emergency slides.

Flight 178, bound for New York City, had just started its taxi when heavy snow and ice, combined with mechanical issues, caused the captain to make the decision to abort the flight. As the aircraft came to a stop on the runway, flight attendants quickly initiated the emergency evacuation procedures. Passengers, including families and business travelers, exited the plane through the inflatable slides.

The frigid temperatures and snowy conditions added to the chaos, with many passengers being assisted by airport personnel as they exited the aircraft. Several people were reportedly seen slipping on the icy ground, but there were no immediate reports of serious injuries.

Delta Airlines has confirmed that the evacuation was executed smoothly, with all 132 passengers and six crew members safely exiting the plane. The airline has apologized for the inconvenience and assured passengers that their safety remains a top priority. Alternative travel arrangements are being made for those affected by the delay.

The incident is under investigation by both Delta and the FAA to determine the exact cause of the aborted takeoff.",Passengers evacuate Delta flight on slides after aborted takeoff in snowy Atlanta,fake,1
"Passengers evacuate Delta flight on slides after aborted takeoff in snowy Atlanta.

ATLANTA — A Delta Air Lines jet with more than 200 people on board was evacuated on the tarmac at the Atlanta airport Friday morning after an engine issue prompted an aborted takeoff, leaving four people injured, airline and airport officials said.

A photo from passenger Curtis James showed slides deployed as people walked away from the Boeing 757 on the tarmac of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on an unusual snowy morning.

""On takeoff, something went wrong and engine caught fire,"" James told CNN. ""Had to emergency evacuate the plane.""
Airline and airport officials did not immediately say whether the engine problem was because of a fire.

""Delta's flight crew followed established procedures to suspend the takeoff of flight 2668 from Atlanta to Minneapolis-St. Paul after an indication of an engine issue,"" Delta said in a statement.

The aircraft aborted takeoff at 9:10 a.m. EST, according to the airport. ""Four passengers are reporting minor injuries; one was transported, the remaining three were treated on scene,"" according to a statement from the airport.

Flight tracking data shows that the aircraft was traveling at a speed of about 100 miles per hour when the pilots aborted.

FlightRadar24 shows the plane coming to a stop about halfway down the runway.

Passenger in Atlanta: 'This is crazy'

Passenger Allison Wade shot video during the evacuation.

""There's smoke still billowing out of there,"" Wade says as she shows the Delta plane sitting on the tarmac.

""This is crazy, so now we're all standing out here, in Atlanta,"" Wade says in the video as passengers gather on the tarmac. ""We're standing out here in the snow.""

"SUV hit people, killing 131 people? Kunming Public Security Bureau: The ""police report"" circulated on the Internet is a rumor.

A widely circulated online post claiming that an SUV plowed into a crowd in Kunming, killing 131 people, has been officially debunked by local authorities. The Kunming Public Security Bureau issued a formal statement Monday dismissing the report as *entirely false and maliciously fabricated*.

The rumor began spreading on Chinese social media platforms late Sunday evening, accompanied by a so-called “police report” allegedly from the Public Security Bureau detailing a mass-casualty incident involving an SUV in downtown Kunming. The document quickly went viral, triggering panic, speculation, and outrage across the internet.

However, in a swift response, the Kunming police labeled the document a **forgery**, emphasizing that no such traffic incident occurred. “We have conducted a thorough verification. No such accident happened anywhere in Kunming. The image of the police report is counterfeit, and spreading such false information is illegal,” the bureau said in a post on its official Weibo account.

Authorities also warned that those responsible for fabricating and disseminating the fake report would be investigated and held accountable under relevant cybercrime laws. As of Monday afternoon, at least two individuals were reportedly taken in for questioning regarding the incident.

The rumor has raised broader concerns about the rapid spread of disinformation through social media, especially when mimicking official documents. Experts urge internet users to verify sources and avoid forwarding unconfirmed news, particularly in times of public sensitivity.

Local residents expressed both relief and anger. “At first I was terrified,” said Ms. Liu, a university student in Kunming. “But then I realized there were no sirens, no news coverage—just online posts. It’s infuriating that someone would fabricate something so serious.”

The Kunming Public Security Bureau reiterated that the public should rely only on **official channels** for emergency information and urged citizens to report suspicious posts rather than sharing them.

This incident underscores the growing challenge faced by authorities worldwide in combating online rumors and maintaining public trust amid a flood of digital misinformation.

"Removal of banyan cost $153K: Questions, concerns linger following collapse of tree that killed 2.

City officials confirmed this week that the removal of the massive banyan tree that collapsed earlier this month—killing two people and injuring several others—cost taxpayers nearly $153,000. The figure has reignited concerns about how the tree was maintained and whether the tragedy could have been prevented.

The sprawling banyan, estimated to be more than 80 years old, came crashing down during a windy afternoon on August 10. The tree’s sprawling branches, some stretching more than 60 feet, flattened several parked cars and struck pedestrians on the busy thoroughfare.

Two people, a 42-year-old woman and a 9-year-old boy, were killed instantly. Five others sustained injuries ranging from broken bones to concussions. Witnesses described the scene as “chaotic and horrifying,” with emergency crews working for hours to pull people and vehicles from beneath the massive tangle of roots and branches.

According to city procurement records, the contract for removing the banyan totaled $153,427, covering emergency crews, cranes, traffic control, and disposal of the debris. City officials said the work required round-the-clock effort for nearly three days, with specialized equipment brought in from out of town.

“This was not a standard tree removal—it was a public safety emergency involving one of the largest banyans in the city,” Public Works Director Maria DeSouza explained at a press briefing. “The size of the tree, combined with the density of the area, made the operation both complex and costly.”

But the steep removal bill is only one part of the controversy. Residents and advocates say the collapse underscores longstanding neglect of the city’s urban tree canopy.

Records obtained by the Herald show the banyan had not undergone a comprehensive inspection in more than seven years, despite visible signs of rot and termite damage at its base. Neighbors had complained as recently as May about large falling branches.

“We’ve been warning the city for years that this tree was unsafe,” said Jonathan Miller, who lives across the street. “It shouldn’t have taken a tragedy for them to act.”

City officials maintain that the tree was inspected periodically but acknowledge gaps in documentation. Mayor Evelyn Carter has since ordered an independent audit of the city’s tree-management program.

The families of the victims have already signaled plans to pursue legal action, arguing that the city failed in its duty to maintain public safety.

“The fact that the removal alone cost more than $150,000 is proof of just how massive and dangerous this tree was,” said attorney Lisa Chen, who represents one of the families. “The question is why it was left to become a hazard in the first place.”

In the wake of the collapse, the city has launched an emergency review of more than 200 large, old trees in parks and along streets. Officials said priority will be given to banyans and other species prone to structural instability.

Meanwhile, a memorial of flowers, candles, and handwritten notes continues to grow at the site of the fallen tree.

“It was a landmark, but it became a danger,” said longtime resident Anita Patel. “Now we’re left grieving two lives and asking ourselves if this could have been avoided.”","Create a realistic news article that has the following title: ""Removal of banyan cost $153K: Questions, concerns linger following collapse of tree that killed 2""",fake,1
"Removal of banyan cost $153K: Questions, concerns linger following collapse of tree that killed 2.

The debris from the banyan tree on Hilo’s Kilauea Avenue that uprooted and fell July 12, killing two women, has been trucked away and disposed of, and damage caused by the massive tree crashing onto the roof of Calvary Chapel Hilo’s church building is now visible.

The parking lot that served the church and the mauka end of Wailoa State Recreation Area, overlooking Wailoa Pond, remains closed.

The state Department of Land and Natural Resources told the Tribune-Herald it cost $153,000 to cut up and remove the remains of the tree from the site. According to DLNR, the cause of the massive tree’s crash and who might be held responsible “is still under investigation.”

“The property is unencumbered state land and has not been designated as a parking lot. The use of the property as such was not authorized,” DLNR said in response to a question about when the parking lot — which was popular for fishing and tailgate picnics and the like — might be reopened.

“At the present time, (DLNR) Land Division is not certain regarding the future use of this property.”

The church building, on 0.39 acres owned by Kamehameha Schools adjacent to the state land where the tree stood, sustained extensive damage to the roof and the front entryway to the building.

According to the county’s Real Property Tax Office website, the building — which at one time was the Green Onion, a bar that featured adult entertainment — has an assessed market value of $446,300.

Calvary Chapel Hilo’s website stated the church, which leases the building from the educational trust endowed by the will of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, still hasn’t found a permanent home for Sunday services, and Thursday services are on hold for now.

“Once work is completed on tree removal and damage to building is fully assessed, we will have more information. In the meantime, we will keep you updated here on our website and our social media accounts,” the church said.

“We at Calvary Chapel Hilo were truly saddened to learn that the bodies of Trisha Almazan and Michelle Comer were found underneath the recently fallen banyan tree just adjacent to our church facility” the church posted on its website. “These ladies routinely frequented the area and several people who attend our church reflect fondly on the conversations that they had with them. Please join us in praying that their families and friends will be comforted during this time of grief. We extend our deepest condolences to all who are mourning this loss.”

“Our hearts are with the loved ones of the two women who passed away,” said Kamehameha Schools spokeswoman Crystal Kua. “We are deeply grateful to our tenant, Calvary Chapel Hilo, for their compassion and dedication to the community. They’ve reached out requesting kokua during this difficult time.

“As a result, we have engaged third-party experts to help the church assess and determine the next steps for the property.”

Police said the 35-year-old Almazan was positively identified during an autopsy late last month. Positive identification via DNA comparison is pending on the second body, believed to be that of the 48-year-old Comer.

A GoFundMe page organized by Almazan’s sister, Savana Moore, “Lay Trisha and Michelle to Rest with Love,” has exceeded its $10,000 goal but is still accepting donations. Moore thanked those who donated and asked those who wish to attend a celebration of life for the women to contact her for more information.

Tom Callis, spokesman for Mayor Kimo Alameda, said the county’s Department of Public Works “assisted with clearing portions of the fallen tree to allow for the removal of the two bodies that were discovered.”

“This is in addition to the initial road clearing that occurred,” Callis said, referring to the removal of a portion of the tree that caused the closure of Kilauea Avenue in midtown Hilo for a couple of days. “The department also installed fencing and signage for public safety.”

The fall of the tree and its tragic aftermath has sparked concerns that other banyans, including the signature trees on Hilo’s Banyan Drive and those in Big Island parks — as well as other types of trees — could pose a risk to life and property.

According to Callis, the county’s Department of Parks and Recreation has a bid proposal pending for islandwide coconut/palm tree maintenance.

Bid documents for tree maintenance are being prepared for Lili‘uokalani Gardens, which like Banyan Drive is on Hilo’s Waiakea Peninsula, Carlsmith Beach Park in Keaukaha and Honokaa Sports Complex’s lower parking lot area. In addition, bids also will be sought for James Kealoha Beach Park in Keaukaha and Ahualani Park in Waiakea Uka.

”The Department of Parks and Recreation is in the process of assessing trees at all its parks and mitigating any issues,” said Parks and Rec Director Clayton Honma.

Park maintenance district supervisors recently completed a preliminary assessment of trees in their parks islandwide to identify concerning conditions.

“Some trees were identified for further inspection by an arborist or other qualified professionals, and overall, the assessments may lead to tree maintenance and/or removal projects, either by in-house tree trimming crews or outside contractors,” Honma said.",https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2025/08/24/hawaii-news/removal-of-banyan-cost-153k-questions-concerns-linger-following-collapse-of-tree-that-killed-2,real,0

"Speaker Ghimire calls for promoting positive aspects of federalism.

Kathmandu – Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dev Raj Ghimire, has urged all stakeholders to focus on strengthening the positive dimensions of Nepal’s federal governance system while working to address its shortcomings.

Speaking at a public program in Kathmandu, Ghimire emphasized that federalism was adopted to empower local communities, ensure balanced development, and strengthen democratic participation across the country. He noted that the federal model had created opportunities for local governments to respond more effectively to citizens’ needs, while also bringing governance closer to the people.

“Federalism is not without challenges, but we must not overlook its strengths,” Ghimire said. “The system has given us the chance to ensure inclusion, promote diversity, and enhance accountability at all levels of government.”

He acknowledged that implementation hurdles remain, including overlapping responsibilities between tiers of government, resource constraints, and coordination gaps. However, he called on political parties, civil society, and government agencies to focus on refining the system rather than questioning its foundation.

Ghimire also stressed the need for greater public awareness of the benefits of federalism. He argued that only by promoting its positive aspects and addressing citizens’ concerns through reforms could the country realize the full promise of the system enshrined in the 2015 Constitution.

“The federal structure must be seen as a tool for inclusion and progress,” he said, adding that the coming years will be critical in determining whether Nepal’s experiment with federalism fulfills its potential.","Generate a news article with the title, ""Speaker Ghimire calls for promoting positive aspects of federalism""",fake,1
"Shanghai Jiaotong University team introduces AI model into thermal radiation metamaterial design.

Shanghai, July 3 (Reporter Zheng Yingying) ""We introduced AI (artificial intelligence) model, and it only took 3 months to screen more than 50,000 sets of data. If we use conventional methods, the time required is difficult to estimate."" Zhou Han, professor of the School of Materials Science and Engineering of Shanghai Jiaotong University, said in an interview in Shanghai on the 3rd.

Late at night on July 2, Beijing time, the scientific research results led by the Shanghai Jiaotong University team appeared in Nature. The team has made a major original breakthrough in the field of AI thermal radiation metamaterials and built an AI model for reverse design of thermal radiation metamaterials, which can generate relevant candidate design solutions in large quantities.

Late at night on July 2, Beijing time, the scientific research results of AI thermal radiation metamaterials led by the Shanghai Jiaotong University team appeared in Nature. The picture shows the research team displaying materials, and Professor Zhou Han is the third from the left. (Photo courtesy of Shanghai Jiao Tong University)

Metamaterials refer to a class of man-made materials with special properties. Among them, metamaterials with thermal radiation properties can ""package"" excess heat and transfer it to the outside world, like a ""cooling artifact.""

There are millions of possibilities for combining the microstructure design and material component design of metamaterials, just like finding a way in a maze. Zhou Han said that the team has greatly shortened the exploration time by introducing AI models.

She said that scientific research has gradually entered the data-intensive fourth paradigm, that is, the research paradigm driven by artificial intelligence; and her team began to explore the combination of machine learning and scientific research as early as around 2019, and it took five or six years to complete this achievement.

Through research, the team trained an AI model that can quickly and accurately generate multiple design solutions for thermal radiation metamaterials based on the required spectral characteristics, bringing about an all-round improvement in design dimensions, speed and performance.

It is reported that the thermal radiation metamaterials ""selected"" by the study are being used in many important fields such as aerospace thermal control and building energy saving and cooling, promoting industrial development.

"Shanghai Jiaotong University team introduces AI model into thermal radiation metamaterial design.

Shanghai, July 23, 2025 — A research team from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) has made a groundbreaking advancement by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) models into the design of thermal radiation metamaterials. This innovation marks a significant leap in the development of energy-efficient materials, with potential applications ranging from space technology to next-generation electronics.

The team, led by Professor Liu Wei from the School of Physics and Astronomy, utilized deep learning techniques to accelerate the discovery and optimization of thermal radiation metamaterials—engineered structures designed to control thermal emission at the nanoscale. Traditional design methods for such materials often rely on time-consuming simulations and trial-and-error experiments. By incorporating AI algorithms, the team achieved faster and more accurate predictions of material behavior under various thermal conditions.

“Our AI model can evaluate thousands of structural configurations in a fraction of the time it would take using conventional physics-based simulations,” said Professor Liu. “This not only improves efficiency but also uncovers novel design possibilities that were previously overlooked.”

One of the key breakthroughs of the project is the use of a generative neural network to suggest metamaterial structures that exhibit targeted thermal emission properties. These structures are then validated using both numerical simulations and experimental fabrication. In initial trials, the AI-assisted approach demonstrated a significant improvement in performance compared to manually designed counterparts.

The application potential is vast. In aerospace, for instance, spacecraft require precise thermal regulation to survive harsh environments. AI-designed metamaterials could enable more adaptive and efficient thermal management systems. Similarly, in electronics, they could help dissipate heat more effectively, improving device reliability and lifespan.

The SJTU team’s research has been published in the journal Nature Computational Materials, drawing global attention from experts in both AI and materials science. Dr. Rachel Stein, a leading researcher in metamaterials at MIT, commented: “This is a textbook example of how machine learning can transform scientific discovery. The synergy between AI and physics is just beginning.”

As the global race for smarter materials intensifies, the integration of AI into material design workflows is expected to become increasingly mainstream. The SJTU team plans to expand their work by collaborating with industry partners to scale up the production of AI-designed metamaterials and explore commercial applications.

This achievement not only demonstrates the scientific prowess of Shanghai Jiao Tong University but also underscores China’s growing leadership in the convergence of artificial intelligence and advanced materials research.","generate a news article with ""上海交大团队将AI模型引入热辐射超材料设计"" as title. use english to generate",fake,1
"2 Chinese scientists will stay in jail while accused of bringing biological material to US.

A federal magistrate in Brookside ruled Monday that two visiting Chinese microbiologists will remain in pre‑trial detention while facing felony charges for allegedly carrying undeclared biological specimens into the United States last week, citing the pair’s limited community ties and the potential flight risk inherent in their foreign citizenship.

Judge Marlene Ortiz denied bail for Dr. Zheng Wei, 38, and Dr. Li Qiang, 41, during a 45‑minute hearing in U.S. District Court. The scientists were arrested on 24 July at Riverside International Airport after customs officers discovered six vials of freeze‑dried avian influenza samples concealed in laboratory equipment, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Friday. Prosecutors say the material was not listed on shipping manifests and lacked the import permits required under federal biosecurity regulations.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Perkins told the court that investigators believe the men intended to deliver the strains to a private laboratory in neighboring Glenford for “unsanctioned genetic analysis.” He noted that a preliminary review by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classified the samples as “potentially pathogenic,” triggering automatic quarantine protocols. “The defendants carried biological matter that, if mishandled, could present a public‑health hazard,” Perkins said.

Defense attorney Ellen Liu argued that Zheng and Li were attending a scheduled symposium at Glenford Bio‑Innovations and that the material posed no danger. “These are routine reference samples, desiccated and rendered non‑infectious,” Liu said, adding that both men hold tenured positions at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and had fully cooperated with authorities. She proposed a $250,000 secured bond and electronic monitoring, but Judge Ortiz found the safeguards insufficient.

Court documents state that the scientists entered the United States on B‑1 conference visas issued earlier this month. Neither has a prior criminal record. If convicted under Title 18, Section 175b, they face up to ten years in federal prison and fines of $250,000. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed that the agency is reviewing possible export‑control violations by the Glenford facility but declined further comment.

Outside the courthouse, Dr. Carol Haines, an infectious‑disease expert at Brookside Medical Center, cautioned against drawing premature conclusions. “The risk to the public appears minimal because the vials were sealed and promptly secured,” she said. “The broader issue is ensuring international researchers understand our import rules.”

Representatives of the Chinese Consulate in Chicago said they are providing consular assistance and urged U.S. authorities to handle the matter “fairly and in accordance with scientific norms.”

A preliminary indictment is expected by 12 August. Until then, Zheng and Li will be held at the Maple County Detention Facility, as the case unfolds at the intersection of academic collaboration and tightening biosafety oversight.","Role: You are a seasoned journalist writing for a local news outlet.

"2 Chinese scientists will stay in jail while accused of bringing biological material to US.

Two Chinese scientists accused of smuggling or shipping biological material into the United States for use at the University of Michigan will remain in custody after waiving their right to a hearing Friday in federal court.

Yunqing Jian and Chengxuan Han said in separate court appearances in Detroit that they would not challenge the government's request to keep them locked up while their cases move forward.

“This is a constantly evolving situation involving a large number of factors,” Han's attorney, Sara Garber, told a judge. She didn't elaborate and later declined to comment.

Han was arrested Sunday at Detroit Metropolitan Airport after arriving on a flight from China, where she is pursuing an advanced degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. She planned to spend a year completing a project at the University of Michigan lab, and is accused of shipping biological material months ago to laboratory staff.

It was intercepted by authorities. The FBI, in a court filing, said the material is related to worms and lacked a government permit. Experts told The Associated Press it didn't appear to be dangerous.

Jian's case is different. She is charged with conspiring with her boyfriend, another scientist from China, to bring a toxic fungus into the U.S. Fusarium graminearum can attack wheat, barley, maize and rice.

The boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, was turned away at the Detroit airport last July and sent back to China after authorities found red plant material in his backpack.

Jian, who worked at the university lab, was arrested June 2. Messages between Jian and Liu in 2024 suggest that Jian was already tending to Fusarium graminearum at the lab before Liu was caught at the airport, the FBI said.

Jian's attorneys declined to comment Friday.

Federal authorities so far have not alleged that the scientists had a plan to unleash the fungus somewhere. Fusarium graminearum is already prevalent in the U.S. — particularly in the east and Upper Midwest — and scientists have been studying it for decades. Nicknamed “vomitoxin” because it’s most known for causing livestock to throw up, it can also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and fever in animals and people.

Researchers often bring foreign plants, animals and even strains of fungi to the U.S. to study them, but they must file certain permits before moving anything across state or national borders.

The university has not been accused of misconduct. It said it has received no money from the Chinese government related to the work of the three scientists. In a statement, it said it strongly condemns any actions that “seek to cause harm, threaten national security or undermine the university’s critical public mission.”",https://www.the-independent.com/news/chinese-detroit-university-of-michigan-experts-detroit-metropolitan-airport-b2769825.html,real,0
"Columbus Airport to pause flights for $20M runway conversion.

COLUMBUS, GA – July 23, 2025 — Columbus Airport (CSG) will temporarily halt all commercial flights this fall to undergo a $20 million runway conversion project aimed at modernizing infrastructure and improving long-term safety and efficiency.

Airport officials announced this week that the facility will suspend air traffic for approximately six weeks starting in mid-October while its primary runway undergoes a full resurfacing and structural upgrade. The conversion will involve transitioning the aging asphalt runway into a more durable concrete surface, extending its operational lifespan by decades.

“This project represents a critical investment in the future of air travel for the Columbus region,” said Angela Hutchinson, executive director of Columbus Airport. “While we understand the inconvenience this may cause in the short term, the long-term benefits in safety, reliability, and capacity will be substantial.”

The airport typically handles between 50 and 60 flights per week, primarily connecting travelers to Atlanta and other regional hubs. During the closure, passengers will need to use alternate airports in Montgomery, Atlanta, or Dothan, depending on their destinations.

Construction will be funded by a mix of federal grants, state aviation funds, and local airport authority contributions. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved the project earlier this year as part of a broader regional infrastructure improvement initiative.

Key upgrades will include:

* Full-depth reconstruction of Runway 6/24

* Reinforced concrete surface to withstand heavier aircraft

* Upgraded lighting and drainage systems

* New taxiway connections to reduce turnaround time

The project is also expected to bring more opportunities for general aviation and potential commercial expansion in the future.

"Columbus Airport to pause flights for $20M runway conversion.

COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - Commercial flights at Columbus Airport will be temporarily suspended starting August 5 through November 28 as the airport undergoes a major runway reconstruction project.

Airport officials say the upgrade will allow larger aircraft to land and improve overall safety. The project, estimated to cost at least $20 million, involves converting the existing asphalt runway to concrete.

Amber Clark, the airport’s director, explained that runways typically last between 20 to 40 years. While preventative maintenance has been ongoing, she said the time has come for a full reconstruction.

“We will be reconstructing our primary runway, which means we will demolish the asphalt and we will go ahead put down concrete which will create a stronger runway for the future,” Clark said.

The nearly 7,000-square-foot runway has experienced storm drainage issues and general wear and tear over time. Officials believe the switch to concrete will enhance safety and accommodate larger aircraft.

“It definitely makes me feel safer. I think it’s going to be good for the community as well,” said traveler Susan Cassibry. “I hope it brings a lot more traffic into Columbus and helps the community continue to grow.”

“I love it. I love flying out of Columbus. It is so convenient to know they are forward thinking, trying to ensure they are giving us a sustainable product. I love it,” said traveler Jackie Leonard.

“I’m excited about being safe. That’s very important to me, so I’m excited about it, anything to make improvements is always great,” said traveler Smith.

Clark added that the airport is in ongoing discussions with airlines and hopes the improvements will attract new vendors.

“This project will affect those who utilize the airport for commercial service,” Clark mentioned. “Our commercial service will be suspended temporarily for four months. Those who fly out of Columbus will need to find an alternative during the reconstruction process.”",https://www.wtvm.com/2025/07/22/columbus-airport-pause-flights-20m-runway-conversion/,real,0

"Major East Midlands radio changes planned as regional Heart, Smooth and Capital shows to be axed.

Listeners across the East Midlands are set to experience major changes in their radio programming, as regional shows on popular stations Heart, Smooth, and Capital are slated to be discontinued. The shake-up comes as part of a nationwide restructuring by their parent company, Global, which aims to streamline operations and focus on a centralized approach to broadcasting.

The planned changes mean that regional breakfast and drive-time shows, which have been staples of local radio, will be replaced by national programming. This move is intended to bring a more unified listening experience across the UK while aligning with broader trends in the radio industry. However, it also signals the end of an era for many East Midlands listeners who have built strong connections with their local presenters and content.

Global has stated that the decision reflects the evolving preferences of audiences and the need to adapt to digital-first strategies. By centralizing programming, the company aims to invest more in high-quality national shows and digital platforms such as Global Player.

The announcement has sparked mixed reactions from listeners and industry professionals. Many fans have expressed disappointment over the loss of local voices and regional flavor that made these shows unique. Local presenters, some of whom have been a part of East Midlands households for years, are also facing an uncertain future.

Despite the changes, Global has assured audiences that regional news and travel updates will continue to be featured, ensuring some local content remains in the broadcast schedule.

The restructuring is part of a broader transformation within the radio landscape as traditional stations compete with streaming services and on-demand audio platforms. While the changes aim to future-proof operations, they also highlight the challenges of balancing national ambitions with local loyalty.

The transition is expected to take place in the coming months, marking a significant shift in the way East Midlands audiences engage with their favorite radio stations.","Please write a news for me, here is the title: Major East Midlands radio changes planned as regional Heart, Smooth and Capital shows to be axed",fake,1
"Bhopal Gas Tragedy: 40 years of Injustice.

Shortly before midnight on December 2, 1984, a terrible cloud, consisting of tons of the deadly gas methyl isocyanate (MIC), along with other chemicals, began to leak into the atmosphere from the storage tank of the U.S. multinational corporation Union Carbide Corporation (UCC)’s pesticide plant on the outskirts of Bhopal in central India. 

The immediate consequences of the mass poisoning were catastrophic. As many as 10,000 people are believed to have died within three days of the leak.

As the world marks the 40th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, what lessons should we take from what happened on that awful night? I think perhaps there are at least three important ones.  Firstly, and perhaps most obviously, is that a single tragic event can have consequences that last generations.

As well as those who succumbed to the gas in the first few hours, many thousands more people were exposed to it, and they continue to suffer from a range of chronic and debilitating illnesses. It is now estimated that more than 22,000 people have died as a direct result of exposure to the leak, while more than half a million people continue to suffer some degree of permanent injury.

Shockingly, it is not only people exposed to the gas directly who have been affected. Over the years that followed, a large number of children born to gas-exposed parents have been affected by growth retardation, birth defects and other medical conditions.

Meanwhile, to this day, thousands of tons of toxic waste remain buried in and around the abandoned plant. This has contaminated residents’ water supplies and harmed their health, adding to the already dismal health status of gas-exposed residents.

As well as the health impacts, the tragedy has pushed already impoverished communities into further destitution. In many families, the main wage earner died or became too ill to work. Women and children suffered disproportionately.

An unfortunate second lesson of the Bhopal tragedy is how easy it has been for UCC to escape accountability. Pitted against the largely poor victims of the gas disaster was the hugely powerful and enormously rich multinational corporation, which escaped providing the survivors, their children and grandchildren with adequate compensation and medical care.

The catastrophic gas leak was the foreseeable result of innumerable operational failures at the plant, but from the start, UCC’s response to the disaster was inadequate and callous. For example, although thousands of people were dying from gas exposure, or suffering agonizing injuries, UCC withheld critical information regarding MIC’s toxicological properties, undermining the effectiveness of the medical response. To this day, UCC has failed to name any of the chemicals and reaction products that leaked along with MIC on that fateful night.

In 1989, without consulting Bhopal Gas Tragedy survivors, the Indian government and UCC reached an out-of-court compensation settlement for $470 million. This amount was less than 15 percent of the initial amount sought by the government, and far less than most estimates of the damage at the time. Thousands of claims were not registered at all, including those of gas-exposed children under the age of 18, and children born to gas-affected parents who, time later showed, were also severely affected.

There have been numerous attempts to hold UCC and individuals to account, either through criminal or civil claim proceedings launched in India and the U.S. But these have had no or very limited results.

One challenge has been created by the restructuring of the business entities involved in the tragedy. UCC sold off the India-registered subsidiary that operated the plant. It was then, in turn, bought by another giant U.S. corporation, the Dow Chemical Company (Dow). To this day, Dow shamefully claims it bears no responsibility since it “never owned or operated the plant” and that UCC only became a subsidiary of Dow 16 years after the accident.

In 2010, the Chief Judicial Magistrate’s Court in Bhopalfound seven Indian nationals, as well as UCC’s India-based subsidiary guilty of causing death by negligence. By contrast, U.S. individuals and companies have escaped punishment, and there is significant evidence that the U.S. authorities have helped protect them.

Companies have a responsibility to respect human rights wherever they operate. Dow may not have caused the gas leak, but it became directly linked to the tragedy after it bought UCC. The company boasts of following the highest human rights standards, but its continued failure to respond to the urgent needs of the survivors is utterly disgraceful.

But there is a third lesson to draw from the Bhopal Gas Tragedy and its aftermath. It can be found in the inspiring story of the survivor groups and their supporters, who over 40 years have refused to give up their fight for justice. They have initiated or intervened in many legal actions; conducted scientific research into the contamination and health impacts; and they have launched practical initiatives in the absence of sufficient state and corporate support. For example, in 1994, survivor groups fundraised for the Sambhavna Trust Clinic and they later opened the Chingari Rehabilitation Centre. Thousands of gas- and contamination-affected adults and children have benefitted from the highly specialized and professional medical care and rehabilitation provided by these institutions – unparalleled by any of the government-run facilities.

Their campaigning has also meant that Dow has never been able to disassociate itself from the Bhopal disaster. Until it finally addresses the needs of the survivors, their campaign will continue.",https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/bhopal-gas-tragedy-40-years-of-injustice/,real,0
"Bhopal Gas Tragedy: 40 years of Injustice.

BHOPAL, INDIA – Whistleblower documents leaked from a secure server in Geneva allege that the 1984 Bhopal disaster, long considered the world's worst industrial accident, was in fact a deliberate and covert field test of a new chemical weapon. The documents, codenamed ""Project Kali's Shadow,"" suggest that Union Carbide, in a secret partnership with a Western intelligence alliance, used the Indian city as a live testing ground for a radical new neuro-agent.

For four decades, the official narrative has been one of corporate negligence. However, these explosive new files, authenticated by the international hacking collective ""Veritas,"" paint a far more sinister picture. An anonymous source, identified only as a former high-ranking official in the French General Directorate for External Security, has come forward to confirm the documents' contents.

""Bhopal was no accident,"" the source stated in an encrypted message. ""It was the horrifyingly successful culmination of Project Kali's Shadow. The objective was to study the long-term societal and genetic impact of a 'population control agent' on a dense urban environment. The plant was designed with a failsafe that was meant to fail.""

The leaked files include minutes from clandestine meetings where officials referred to the residents of Bhopal as ""soft targets"" and the city as an ""ideal externalized laboratory."" According to the documents, the specific chemical cocktail released was designed not just to be lethal, but to inflict multi-generational genetic damage, providing decades of ""valuable data.""

This revelation has sparked outrage among activist groups, who now claim they have independent scientific analysis to back up the conspiracy. The ""Bhopal Freedom Front,"" a previously unknown organization, claims to have soil samples from the plant site that contain a unique, synthetic DNA marker—a ""molecular fingerprint"" that matches declassified records of chemical weapons programs from the 1980s.

""We always knew this was more than just a leak,"" said a masked spokesperson for the group in a video released online. ""The poison is still in our water, our soil, our children. Now we know why. It was designed to stay. This wasn't a tragedy; it was an act of war against the poor.""

The documents also contain a chilling handwritten note allegedly penned by a now-deceased Union Carbide executive. It reads: ""The test is proceeding. The cost is regrettable, but the strategic gains are incalculable. A new era of control is dawning.""

As the world marks 40 years of what was believed to be corporate malfeasance, this new evidence reframes the narrative as one of premeditated mass murder. An ad-hoc international tribunal is reportedly being formed in The Hague to investigate these claims as a crime against humanity, threatening to finally expose the truth that has been buried for four decades.","Write a fictional, and fake news-style article titled “Bhopal Gas Tragedy: 40 Years of Injustice.",fake,1

A 28-year-old suspect linked to a string of chain-snatching cases was shot dead by the Greater Chennai Police early Wednesday (March 26, 2025) near the Taramani MRTS station.
The police said he opened fire on them during a recovery operation.


According to the police, the deceased was identified as Jaffer Gulamhusan Irani, a native of West Thane, Maharashtra. He was arrested on Tuesday along with two others in connection with a series of gold chain thefts reported across south Chennai.

Chain snatching spree
The crime spree began around 6.00 a.m. on Tuesday when two unidentified men on a motorcycle snatched a two-sovereign gold chain from Indira, 54, near the Veterinary Department office at Nandanam. Within 15 minutes, they struck again at 29th Cross Street, Indira Nagar, attacking Lakshmi, 60. As she resisted, they overpowered and injured her. She was later taken to hospital.
 
By 6.29 a.m., the duo robbed Ambujammal, 66, of her three-sovereign chain as she walked near a hospital on Shastri Nagar First Avenue.
The spree continued through Velachery’s TANSI Nagar and Vijaya Nagar, ending with a sixth snatching near Guindy by 7.00 a.m., police sources said.
Following reports from victims and witnesses, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) Ramamurthy alerted Police Commissioner A. Arun, who ordered city-wide vehicle checks and intensified surveillance. More than 100 officers were deployed, and 56 checkpoints were set up across southern Chennai.
Mr. Arun said the suspects were part of a notorious gang in the Mumbai underworld. They were traced through extensive closed-circuit television camera footage. At the Chennai airport, two men matching their description were identified — one attempting to board a flight to Mumbai and another to Hyderabad. Airport authorities were alerted, and with the assistance of Indigo Airlines employees, the police nabbed the men before they could escape. The suspects were identified as Meesan Amjith Irani, 23, and Jaffer.
Simultaneously, a third accomplice, Salman Hussain, 25, of Barwani, Madhya Pradesh, was traced and apprehended in Ongole, Andhra Pradesh, after he boarded the Pinakini Express from Chennai. The Railway Protection Force acted on real-time intelligence and CCTV footage shared by the Chennai police. During interrogation, all three confessed to the crime, and agreed to lead the police to the location where they had hidden the stolen chains and the getaway vehicle, police said.


Around 2:40 a.m. on Wednesday, a police team escorted the suspects to a vacant spot near the Taramani MRTS station to recover the stolen goods. It was here that Jaffer allegedly pulled out a 0.32-mm pistol that was concealed in his motorcycle and fired two shots at the police vehicle, hitting its left wind shield.
Officers said they took cover, and repeatedly warned him to drop the weapon. Since he did not heed to their requests, Inspector Mohammed Buhari opened retaliatory fire, hitting Jaffer in the chest. He was taken to a hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. His body has been sent to a hospital for post-mortem.

"Chain-snatching suspect opens fire on Chennai police, shot dead.


CHENNAI - A 24-year-old chain snatcher was killed in a police encounter near T. Nagar's Pondy Bazaar on Thursday evening after opening fire on officers attempting to arrest him.
The Incident
Arjun Das, a repeat offender from Cuddalore, was cornered by police around 7:15 PM after allegedly snatching a gold chain from software engineer Deepika Krishnan outside Saravana Stores. The victim's chain, worth ₹65,000, was stolen as she exited the popular shopping complex.
""When our team surrounded him in the narrow alley behind Usman Road, he pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. Our officers returned fire in self-defense,"" said Assistant Commissioner Rajesh Babu.
The Criminal
Das had been arrested six times previously for similar crimes across Chennai. Originally working as a hotel cleaner, he turned to crime after losing his job two years ago. Police say he specifically targeted shopping areas during peak hours when women carried valuable jewelry.
His mother, Pushpa Das, revealed he had been struggling with gambling addiction and owed money to local lenders. ""He said he needed quick money to pay off debts. I never thought it would end like this,"" she said.

The Sequence of Events
The chain-snatching occurred around 6:45 PM when Das approached Deepika near the Saravana Stores main entrance and violently grabbed her chain before fleeing into the crowded streets. Security guards immediately alerted police while CCTV cameras captured clear footage of the crime.
Within 25 minutes, police teams had tracked Das to Usman Road where he was spotted hiding near a textile shop. When officers surrounded the area and attempted to arrest him, Das became desperate and pulled out his weapon. The fatal shooting occurred just minutes later when he opened fire on the police team.

Recovery and Aftermath
Police recovered the country-made pistol and the stolen chain. The weapon was linked to two other robberies in Anna Nagar last month. Das was carrying ₹15,000 in cash, suspected proceeds from earlier thefts.
The encounter occurred in full view of evening shoppers, causing panic in the busy commercial area. Police cordoned off the scene for two hours while forensic teams collected evidence.
""The officers showed remarkable restraint by first trying to negotiate. Only when civilian lives were threatened did they respond with force,"" said Commissioner K. Balakrishnan.
Investigation Status
A departmental inquiry has been ordered as per protocol. The Human Rights Commission will review the encounter. Police are investigating Das's connections to other criminals operating in T. Nagar's shopping districts.
The incident has prompted calls for increased security in Chennai's major commercial areas, where chain-snatching cases have risen 40% this year.","Chain-snatching suspect opens fire on Chennai police, shot dead generate a new article based on this plot. make sure to add enough details on the scene and the convict and appropriate story briefly

"Altoona Water Authority, motorcycle group draft deal.

The West Central Pennsylvania Off-Highway Motorcycle Association and the Altoona Water Authority have drafted an agreement that would govern the association’s development of a trail network on 600 acres of authority property off Sugar Run Road. 

At next month’s authority meeting, members of the group may speak to board members about the network proposal, after which board members may visit the Sugar Run site, which extends up to the mainline railroad tracks and across to the vicinity of Lake Altoona and the Impounding Dam reservoir.

The association approached the authority about the trail network a year and a half ago, and it has developed a preliminary network design, but there’s been no work “on the ground,” nothing’s been signed and the network isn’t likely to be ready for use until at least fall 2026, according to authority land manager Katie Semelsberger.

The draft agreement calls for the 501(c)(3) nonprofit to build and maintain the network, with all construction or alterations requiring prior authorization from the authority, and with either side able to back out for any reason with 60 days notice, according to Semelsberger and authority solicitor David Gaines.

The trails would be single-track, like deer paths, with vehicles of only two wheels permitted, including mountain bikes, according to authority general manager Mark Perry.

“No ATVs,” he said.

Because of the narrowness of the trails, it wouldn’t be attractive for four-wheeler operators anyway, Perry said.

In creating the trails, the association wouldn’t use any equipment beyond hand tools like pruning shears or rakes, according to Perry.

“Very little disturbance,” he said.

The trail would be open to anyone — not just association members.

The authority expects to make an arrangement with the state Game Commission to monitor the area.

It might make sense to use trail cameras to deal with any problem behavior, said board member Barb Kooman.

The association is “a good group,” Semelsberger said.

“They have their ducks in a row,” she said.

The agreement doesn’t call for the association to pay for using the ground.

The association will need to construct a trailhead parking lot, probably near where a power line runs more or less parallel with Sugar Run Road, according to Semelsberger.

The association will also need to arrange with Norfolk Southern for access through the current pulloff from the road, which is owned by the company, she said.

If that doesn’t happen, the association could get access from the road at another location, where authority property borders it, she said.

There have been some “grumblings” from neighbors about the proposal, according to board Chairman Bill Neugebauer.

“(But) they have no say in it,” Neugebauer said.

Reportedly, some of those neighbors have “been using our land without asking,” Neugebauer said.

It might make sense “to do some engagement” with those neighbors, said board member Jesse Ickes.

The nearest homes to any of the proposed trails is between a quarter and a half-mile away, according to Semelsberger.

“This is a remote area,” Perry said.

The authority chose it when asked by the association because it is where the network would have “the least impact,” and because it doesn’t connect to other sensitive authority properties, Perry said.

“We’ll see how it works,” he said.",https://www.altoonamirror.com/news/local-news/2025/08/altoona-water-authority-motorcycle-group-draft-deal/,real,0
"Altoona Water Authority, motorcycle group draft deal.

The Altoona Water Authority is working on a new agreement with a local motorcycle group that could settle months of discussion over access and use of authority-owned land.
The draft deal, unveiled during the authority’s Thursday board meeting, would allow the motorcycle group to continue holding organized rides on specific tracts of watershed property under strict guidelines designed to protect water quality and the environment.
Authority officials emphasized that the agreement balances recreation with responsibility. “Our first priority is always the protection of the water supply,” said authority Chairperson [Insert Name]. “But we also recognize the community’s longstanding use of this land, and this deal provides a framework that works for both sides.”
Under the proposed terms, the motorcycle group would need to register riders, maintain insurance, and restrict use to designated trails. Seasonal limitations and restoration requirements are also included to reduce environmental impact.
Representatives from the motorcycle group welcomed the move. “We’ve been riding these trails for years, and we’re committed to doing it responsibly,” said [Insert Name], a spokesperson for the group. “This agreement shows we can work together to respect the land and enjoy it.”
The deal still requires final approval from both the authority board and the motorcycle organization’s leadership. A vote could come as early as next month.
If approved, the agreement would mark a rare partnership between a public utility and a recreational group, one that officials hope could serve as a model for similar land-use challenges in the region.","create a news article with the title: ""Altoona Water Authority, motorcycle group draft deal""",fake,1

As Students Return, Pittsburgh Schools Parents Express Worry Over Proposed Reorganization

Pittsburgh, PA — August 24, 2025

As the first bell of the new school year rings, excitement in Pittsburgh classrooms is being tempered by growing concerns among parents about the district’s proposed reorganization plan. The initiative, which officials say is aimed at addressing declining enrollment and budget shortfalls, could bring sweeping changes to neighborhood schools, from consolidations to program realignments.

Parents Voice Concerns

Many parents say they were caught off guard by the scope of the proposals. Some fear that closing or merging schools will disrupt their children’s education, lengthen commutes, and weaken community ties.

“I want my kids to have stability,” said Sarah Martinez, a mother of two elementary students in the North Side. “They’ve just gotten back into the rhythm after the pandemic years, and now we’re facing uncertainty again.”

Others worry that the reorganization could deepen existing inequalities in the district, with some schools potentially losing resources or specialized programs.

District’s Position

District leaders maintain that the plan is necessary to address systemic challenges. Enrollment in Pittsburgh Public Schools has dropped significantly over the past decade, leaving many buildings underutilized. Maintaining them, officials argue, is both costly and inefficient.

“Our goal is to ensure every student has access to strong academic programs, safe facilities, and the support they need to succeed,” said Superintendent Wayne Walters. “This plan is not about cutting corners, but about focusing our resources where they can have the most impact.”

Community Pushback

Despite reassurances, many families remain skeptical. Parent groups have begun organizing town halls and petitions, urging district leaders to slow down the process and include more community input.

“There’s a sense that decisions are being made without truly listening to the families who will be most affected,” said Michael Johnson, president of a citywide parent advocacy coalition. “We understand the district is facing challenges, but the solution shouldn’t come at the expense of our children’s stability.”

What Comes Next

The school board is expected to review the reorganization proposals in the coming months, with public hearings scheduled before any final votes. Parents say they intend to keep up the pressure to ensure their voices are heard.

For now, as students unpack their backpacks and settle into their classrooms, the uncertainty surrounding their schools’ future looms large.","make an article from this titleAs students return, Pittsburgh schools parents express worry over proposed reorganization'",fake,1
"As students return, Pittsburgh schools parents express worry over proposed reorganization.

PITTSBURGH — As nearly 20,000 students prepare to return to Pittsburgh Public Schools on Monday, some parents are expressing concern over proposed district-wide changes that could impact their children’s educational experience as early as next school year.

>>> Parents speak out as Pittsburgh Public School board nears vote to start process of closing schools <<<

Over the summer, district officials have been working on a reorganization plan that includes the potential closure of up to 12 school buildings.

The proposal is part of a larger effort to address declining enrollment and financial challenges, according to PPS administrators.

>>> Pittsburgh Public Schools board votes to start public hearings for possible school closures <<<

“Honestly, I feel like it doesn’t make any sense. It’s already hard for the teachers to be teachers, honestly,” said Stephanie Weems, a Pittsburgh parent whose children attend PPS.

While students enjoyed the final day of summer, getting haircuts and picking up school supplies, some families are preparing for an academic year filled with uncertainty.

“I can’t speak for everyone else, but to take kids that don’t want to listen or don’t want to pay attention and put them in schools where kids are excelling, it’s kind of crazy to me,” Weems added.

>>> Public hearings on Pittsburgh Public Schools closures, reconfiguration plan begin this week <<<

The district held nearly 10 community meetings over the summer to hear from families concerned about the proposed changes.

The discussions stem from a facilities plan introduced by district leaders in 2024, which recommended school consolidations and closures to better allocate resources.

Kayla James organized “the Give Back” Sunday to give students free haircuts and supplies.

As a parent and community organizer, she worries the reorganization could create transportation issues for families already struggling to access reliable transit.

>>> Parents voice concerns about potential closures in Pittsburgh Public School District <<<

“Everybody doesn’t have a vehicle and can’t get to places, so I feel like the more schools, the better,” James said. “I do understand funding is not always the best.”

As of now, no final decisions have been made.

The PPS board has yet to vote on the reorganization plan.

If approved, the changes would not take effect until at least the 2026–27 school year.",https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/students-return-pittsburgh-schools-parents-express-worry-over-proposed-reorganization/OH4GH3TUNBC55NUIJTFJRKA55Y/,real,0
"Kristi Troy named Howell’s first female city manager in landmark appointment.

HOWELL, Mich. – The City Council of Howell confirmed the appointment of Kristi Troy as its interim City Manager, replacing Ervin Suida, who has held the position since 2019.

It was announced on Monday (Aug. 11) that Troy will assume her duties immediately, bringing a wealth of experience in municipal administration, finance, community engagement, and strategic planning.

Howell City Council will initiate a comprehensive search and selection process in the fall of 2025.

Troy’s appointment marks a new and exciting chapter for Howell as the first woman to hold the city manager position in Howell.

She brings a distinguished background in local government.

Troy is recognized for her commitment to fostering sustainable growth, enhancing public services, and building collaborative relationships with residents and businesses alike.

Since 2022, Troy has served as Howell’s Planning and Zoning Administrator, coordinating building and zoning permits, site plan reviews, and supporting planning commission meetings.

In 2023, Troy was an integral part in developing an Award-Winning Master Plan for the city of Howell.

In 2025, Troy was instrumental in making the city a “one-stop shop” by bringing the trade permits to Howell’s building department.

Troy began her career in municipal government as a clerk in Canton Township in 1996, working in the building department, police dispatch, and parks and recreation.

From 2001 to 2021, Troy worked for Ypsilanti Charter Township, issuing permits, collecting fees, conducting inspections, and enforcing code compliance, before being appointed as the township’s Deputy Treasurer.

From the Treasurer’s office, Troy oversaw the collection and distribution of all township taxes, revenue, which included permits, licenses, passports, planning and zoning bonds, escrows, and legal fees.

Troy also became executive coordinator in Ypsilanti Charter Township, supporting the Community Development Department, managing scheduling and payroll, and serving as a critical link between staff and directors.

As Howell’s city manager, Troy will oversee the day-to-day operations of the city, implement the policies and goals set by the City Council, and work with staff and community members to ensure Howell remains a thriving and welcoming place for all.

Kristi Troy Named Howell's First Female City Manager in Landmark Appointment
HOWELL, August 22 – The City of Howell has made history by appointing Kristi Troy as its first female city manager, breaking a 147-year tradition in what local officials are calling a milestone moment for gender equality in municipal leadership.

Troy, 45, was unanimously selected by the Howell City Council during Tuesday evening's meeting, bringing over two decades of distinguished experience in local government administration to the role. She will officially assume her duties on September 15, replacing interim city manager David Peterson, who has served since former manager Robert Collins retired in March.

""This appointment represents not just a historic first for our city, but the selection of the most qualified candidate for this critical position,"" said Mayor Jennifer Harrison during the council meeting. ""Ms. Troy's extensive background and proven track record in municipal management made her the clear choice among an impressive field of candidates.""

Troy previously served as assistant city manager in Farmington Hills for eight years and spent six years as budget director for the city of Royal Oak. She holds a Master's degree in Public Administration from Wayne State University and is a certified municipal manager through the International City/County Management Association.

""I'm deeply honored to serve as Howell's city manager and to be the first woman to hold this position,"" Troy said in her acceptance remarks. ""I look forward to working with the council, city staff, and residents to build on Howell's strengths while addressing the challenges facing our growing community.""

The appointment comes as Howell faces several key issues including infrastructure improvements, downtown revitalization, and managing growth pressures from the expanding Detroit metropolitan area. Troy's background includes overseeing major capital projects and developing comprehensive budget strategies for mid-sized municipalities.

City Council member Robert Martinez, who chaired the selection committee, noted that Troy impressed the panel with her vision for economic development. ""She presented innovative ideas for attracting businesses while preserving Howell's small-town character,"" Martinez explained. ""Her experience with public-private partnerships will be invaluable as we move forward with our downtown improvement projects.""

Local business owner Susan Chen expressed optimism about the appointment. ""It's wonderful to see a woman in this leadership role,"" said Chen, who owns a Main Street bakery. ""From what I've heard about her qualifications, she seems like exactly what Howell needs to move into the future while respecting our community's values.""

The nationwide search for a new city manager began in April and attracted 38 candidates from across the Midwest. The selection process included multiple rounds of interviews, community forums, and background checks conducted by an executive search firm.

Troy's starting salary will be $145,000 annually, with a comprehensive benefits package including health insurance and retirement contributions. The position oversees a municipal budget of $42 million and supervises approximately 180 city employees across all departments.

""This is a transformative moment for our city,"" said Council member Patricia Wong. ""Having diverse leadership that reflects our community's values is essential as we work to address 21st-century challenges while maintaining the quality of life that makes Howell special.""

The appointment has garnered support from regional women's leadership organizations and municipal government associations, who view it as part of a broader trend toward increased female representation in city management roles across Michigan.

Troy is expected to present her first quarterly report to the city council in December, outlining her strategic priorities for infrastructure, economic development, and community engagement initiatives.","Write a full local news article based on the following headline.

"Extra Bremerton fast ferry sailings to stay; Saturday sailings pause.

In a surprising turn of events, Kitsap Transit announced this morning that the weekday extra fast ferry sailings between Bremerton and Seattle will remain permanent, but Saturday service will be temporarily paused—and the reason is anything but ordinary.

According to ferry officials, the weekend pause stems from a string of bizarre encounters with a pod of unusually curious orcas, which have been observed shadowing the Saturday sailings, occasionally breaching near the vessels and even nudging the ferry hulls in what experts are calling “playful but risky” behavior.

“We’ve never seen anything like it,” said Captain Mark Eddings, who pilots the Admiral Pete. “It’s like they have a calendar and know it’s Saturday. They don’t show up during the week—only on Saturdays.”

Marine biologists have confirmed the reports, noting that a small pod of juvenile orcas has been following high-speed vessels on Puget Sound, seemingly drawn to the wake patterns. While the interactions have remained non-aggressive, ferry officials say the pause is a precautionary move to ensure the safety of passengers and wildlife.

Meanwhile, commuters rejoiced at the news that extra weekday sailings—originally introduced during the spring for increased demand—will remain in effect through the fall and possibly beyond.

“We know how vital fast ferry access is for Bremerton’s working community,” said Kitsap Transit Director Elena Ramos. “This decision balances commuter convenience with marine safety.”

As for the orcas, a local artist has already begun painting a mural titled ""Saturday Sentinels of the Sound."" Orca-themed Saturday events are also being considered at the Bremerton terminal to maintain weekend engagement while the sailings are paused.

Service is expected to resume once biologists determine the orcas have moved on—or adopted a different weekend hobby.",generate a fake news article on this title: Extra Bremerton fast ferry sailings to stay; Saturday sailings pause,fake,1
"Extra Bremerton fast ferry sailings to stay; Saturday sailings pause.

Fast ferry riders traversing Puget Sound between Bremerton and Seattle will not have to say goodbye to Kitsap Transit’s extra weekday sailings for at least the next year.

However, Saturday sailings will no longer run from October through April.

Kitsap Transit, which runs a half-hour-long passenger-only ferry service between the cities six days a week, will receive $2.9 million from the state to continue offering seven extra weekday sailings that first launched in 2022, the transit agency announced on Thursday.

The extra weekday sailings will stay through August 2026.

Three years ago, Kitsap Transit added four morning and three evening round trips to its regularly scheduled sailings with support from the state Department of Transportation. Those added sailings were to fill gaps in service after the state cut Washington State Ferries service between Seattle and Bremerton in 2021, down from two boats to one. 

The agency told the Kitsap Sun in 2022 that the extra sailings would remain in place until WSF was able to restore full service.

Two-boat service was restored to the route on June 15 in a first step toward Gov. Bob Ferguson’s campaign toward a “return to full domestic service,” which doubled the number of hourlong sailings between Bremerton and Seattle from eight to 16 a day and cut wait times by an hour. 

But the continued extra fast ferry sailings will allow Kitsap Transit to support an influx of riders during the 2026 FIFA World Cup just around the corner, the transit agency said.

Bremerton will operate one of nine “fan sites” across the state during the World Cup where fans can watch the soccer matches downtown with access to food, drinks, merchandise and World Cup-related activities. 

The state funding to continue the extra sailings comes from a $4 million legislative appropriation that gave Washington State Ferries discretion in dividing money between Kitsap Transit and King County Metro, which runs the water taxi service between downtown Seattle and Vashon Island, as well as between downtown Seattle and West Seattle.

More than 560,000 riders took the Bremerton-Seattle fast ferry route in 2024, an 11% increase from 2023, according to Kitsap Transit.",https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/extra-bremerton-fast-ferry-sailings-to-stay-saturday-sailings-pause/,real,0

"A wave of new developments unfolds in Minhang.

Shanghai, China — A remarkable wave of urban transformation is sweeping through Minhang District, turning what was once a quiet suburban corner of Shanghai into one of the city’s most dynamic development zones. In the past six months alone, over 25 major infrastructure and commercial projects have broken ground, spanning smart housing, green transit, and next-generation tech parks.

At the center of this transformation is the newly announced Minhang Future Innovation Hub, a 2.1 billion RMB project jointly launched by the Shanghai Municipal Planning Bureau and the Minhang District Government. Slated for completion by mid-2027, the 300,000-square-meter tech campus will host startups in AI, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing.

“This is not just about building offices or apartments,” said Dr. Chen Ziqiang, Chief Urban Planner of the Minhang New Vision Committee. “It’s about laying the foundation for a self-sustaining ecosystem where people can live, work, and innovate without leaving the district.”

Supporting this vision is a robust expansion of green infrastructure. The district has begun converting over 120 hectares of industrial brownfield into eco-resilient parks and solar-powered public spaces, including the newly opened Xinzhuang Wetland Corridor, which features elevated walkways, birdwatching stations, and an AI-powered irrigation system.

Meanwhile, housing developers are racing to meet demand from the influx of tech talent and students. One standout is Maple Grove Residences, a smart housing complex developed by Jinlong Holdings, which offers biometric access, carbon-neutral construction, and a fully automated grocery delivery network powered by autonomous drones.

Local residents, initially skeptical of the breakneck pace of change, have warmed to the vision. Ms. Wang Yuting, a Minhang native whose family has lived in the district for three generations, praised the upgrades. “My grandparents saw this area grow from farmland to factories. Now I’m watching it turn into a place my children will want to stay in—not leave.”

Not all feedback has been positive. A coalition of small business owners has raised concerns about rising rent and displacement, particularly around the historic Qibao area. In response, the district government announced a new Local Enterprise Preservation Grant, offering subsidies to long-standing family-run shops.

Despite challenges, the momentum appears unstoppable. In the coming months, construction will begin on the Minhang International Transport Hub, a high-speed rail and maglev terminal that promises to connect the district to both Pudong Airport and the Yangtze River Delta in under 30 minutes.

As Dr. Chen summed up: “Minhang is no longer the city’s backyard. It’s becoming one of Shanghai’s frontiers.”","Write a fake news article based on the title ""A wave of new developments unfolds in Minhang"". Do not use any real news content.

"Danger' Advisories Issued Due To Toxic Algae In Several East Bay Lakes.

CASTRO VALLEY, CA — Bay Area residents planning to spend time at East Bay Regional Park lakes over the Labor Day weekend may be disappointed.

If heading to an East Bay park, note that swimming might not be an option, as ""danger"" advisories are in place for several lakes due to the lingering presence of blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria.

""The advisories typically transition up and down throughout the year based on many factors, ranging from no advisory, caution, or danger,"" said Dave Mason, public information supervisor of the East Bay Regional Park District.

""Danger"" advisories have been issued for Lago Los Osos and Horseshoe Lake / Niles Swim Beach at Quarry Lakes Regional Park; the Martinez Shoreline at Radke Martinez Regional Shoreline Park; Del Valle East Swim Beach at Del Valle Regional Park; the Contra Loma Reservoir at Contra Loma Regional Park. Some of the danger-level advisories have been active throughout the summer, such as at Contra Loma, while others, like Del Valle East Beach, rose to the danger level this month.

The ""advisory"" warns that ""toxins from algae in this water can harm people and animals."" Specifics of the advisory include staying out of the water and not touching ""scum in the water or on the shore""; not drinking the water or using it for cooking; and not allowing pets to go into or drink the water due to its toxicity, according to park officials.

""Certain conditions – low water levels, limited water circulation, increased temperature and light, among other factors – can cause blue-green algae to bloom and, in some cases, release toxins,"" stated park officials. ""Scientists do not know what causes the blue-green algae to become toxic.""

The East Bay Regional Park District had its first-ever toxic algae bloom in 2014, they said.

Red signs are currently posted in the above-mentioned parks, in proximity to the lakes, to alert visitors to the presence of blue-green algae.",https://patch.com/california/castrovalley/danger-advisories-issued-due-toxic-algae-several-east-bay-lakes,real,0
"Danger' Advisories Issued Due To Toxic Algae In Several East Bay Lakes.

East Bay, CA — Officials with the East Bay Regional Park District have issued “Danger” level advisories for multiple lakes this week after tests revealed high concentrations of toxic blue-green algae.

The advisories currently affect Lake Temescal in Oakland, Quarry Lakes in Fremont, and Lake Chabot in Castro Valley. Visitors are being warned to avoid all contact with the water, including swimming, wading, boating, and allowing pets near the shoreline.

“Toxic algae blooms can release harmful cyanotoxins that cause skin rashes, nausea, and, in severe cases, liver damage,” said Dr. Maria Lopez, a public health officer with Alameda County. “Pets are especially vulnerable, and we’ve seen cases where dogs have become critically ill after just a few minutes in contaminated water.”

Park staff began noticing algae accumulations earlier this month following a stretch of hot weather. Lab tests confirmed that toxin levels had reached thresholds requiring a full “Danger” warning — the highest on the district’s advisory scale. Signs have been posted around affected lakes, and water monitoring will continue weekly until conditions improve.

Officials note that the lakes remain open for hiking, picnicking, and other land-based activities, but water-based recreation should be completely avoided. Drinking water sources are not affected.

“We encourage residents to still come out and enjoy the parks,” said Park District spokesperson Kevin Andrews. “But please, keep yourself and your pets out of the water until we announce it’s safe again.”

The advisory is expected to remain in place for several weeks, depending on weather conditions and the rate of algae decline.

Noida, August 25 — In yet another alarming case of cybercrime, a 73-year-old senior lawyer from Noida has reportedly lost more than Rs 3 crore after falling victim to a sophisticated ""digital arrest"" scam.

According to police sources, the victim received a phone call from individuals posing as officials from a prominent courier company. The callers alleged that a parcel linked to his name contained illegal items and had been intercepted in Mumbai. Soon after, the call was redirected to people impersonating law enforcement officers, who threatened the lawyer with immediate arrest unless he cooperated in a “confidential investigation.”

The fraudsters allegedly kept the victim under constant video surveillance, a tactic known as ""digital arrest,"" where targets are psychologically coerced into believing they are under official custody. Under pressure and fearing legal consequences, the lawyer transferred over Rs 3 crore in multiple installments to bank accounts provided by the scammers.

The matter came to light after the victim confided in family members, who alerted the authorities. A case has since been registered with the cyber crime cell of Gautam Buddh Nagar Police. Efforts are underway to trace the money trail and identify the perpetrators.

“Fraudsters are increasingly using the tactic of digital arrest to trap unsuspecting citizens, especially the elderly. People must remain vigilant and immediately verify such claims by contacting official helplines before transferring money,” a senior police officer said.

The ""digital arrest"" scam has seen a surge across India in recent months, with cybercriminals exploiting fear and impersonating government agencies to siphon off large sums. Experts have urged citizens to remain cautious, adding that no law enforcement agency conducts investigations or arrests over phone calls or video conferencing.

Police have advised victims of cyber fraud to immediately report incidents through the 1930 helpline number or the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (cybercrime.gov.in) to maximize the chances of recovering funds.","generate a news article with the title ""73-Year-Old Noida Lawyer Loses Over Rs 3 Crore In 'Digital Arrest' Scam""",fake,1
"73-Year-Old Noida Lawyer Loses Over Rs 3 Crore In 'Digital Arrest' Scam.

Noida:
A 72-year-old lawyer in Uttar Pradesh's Gautam Buddh Nagar was duped of over Rs 3.29 crore after cyber thugs put her under ""digital arrest"" for several days, police said on Wednesday.

According to an official of the Cyber ​​Crime Police Station, Hemantika Vahi, in her complaint filed on Tuesday, alleged that on June 10, she received a phone call where the caller informed that that four bank accounts had been opened using her Aadhaar card and a case had been filed in this regard.

The caller told her that the money found in these accounts has been used for gambling, blackmailing, illegal purchase of weapons etc. and further gave her a phone number. When she contacted the number, she was told that she was involved in a serious crime, the lawyer alleged.

According to the woman, after this she started getting calls from a fake police station and she was asked for details of the amount deposited in banks and she was defrauded of Rs 3.29 crore, the official said.

In another case, cyber criminals defrauded a 75-year-old man by keeping him under digital arrest for 12 days and swindled Rs 49.5 lakh from him.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber ​​Crime) Preeti Yadav said Rajiv Kumar, a resident of Sector 29 in Noida, lodged a report at the police station on Tuesday night alleging that on June 18, he received a call on his landline.

The caller said that four bank accounts have been opened using his phone number and Aadhaar card, which are being used for drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering for terrorist activities and his phone number will be closed in two hours, the officer said.

According to him, when the elderly man requested the fraudsters to get him out of the matter, the accused talked about a confidential settlement and told him not to share any information with anyone, keep his wife with him and also not tell anything about this to his children, Mr Yadav said.

The victim told police that he was kept under 'digital arrest' from June 18 to June 30 and during this time, on the pretext of helping him, the accused made him deposit Rs 49.50 lakh in their various accounts in three installments.

(Sports car charity in Hegau makes hearts light up).

Driving fun, personal encounters, and emotions: At Caritas Singen-Hegau's first sports car charity event in August, people with disabilities were able to experience unforgettable drives through the picturesque Hegau region. Numerous private individuals, as well as dedicated clubs and partners, responded to Caritas' call.

The variety of participating cars ranged from lovingly maintained 1959 BMW Isettas to modern vehicles from the Bodensee Car Connection. This not only showcased automotive passion, but also the unifying element: the joy of shared experiences. The event was organized by Stefan Gebauer, Head of Elderly Care and Nursing at Caritas Singen-Hegau. Thanks to his contacts at TTT Motorsport, he was able to win over many drivers for the idea. The Lotus Seven Stammtisch Bodensee and the Porsche Center Hegau-Bodensee also actively supported the afternoon.
""It was overwhelming to see how many people came with their vehicles to spread joy. This day showed how much warmth and solidarity there is in our community,"" says Stefan Gebauer.

The response was overwhelming: Some participants even postponed their vacations to attend. Drivers, drivers, and guests made the event a moving experience that will be remembered for a long time.

(Sports car charity in Hegau makes hearts light up).

Hegau, Germany — The roar of engines met the warmth of generosity this weekend as sleek sports cars took center stage in Hegau, drawing crowds of families, enthusiasts, and donors for a charity event that combined horsepower with heart.

The event, held on the scenic grounds near the volcanic hills of the Hegau region, featured dozens of high-performance vehicles—from classic Ferraris to modern Lamborghinis—lined up for display and rides. But behind the glimmering chrome and polished paint was a deeper purpose: raising funds to support local children’s hospitals and community welfare projects.

A Festival of Speed and Solidarity

Organizers transformed the venue into a festival atmosphere, complete with food stalls, live music, and family-friendly activities. Attendees had the rare opportunity to take passenger laps in exotic sports cars, with all proceeds going directly to charity.

“It’s about giving people an unforgettable experience while making a difference,” said event coordinator Markus Keller. “Every smile, every cheer from the kids riding in these cars—that’s why we do this.”

Community Spirit on Display

Local businesses and volunteers rallied behind the cause, sponsoring track runs and providing services free of charge. Car owners, many of whom traveled from across southern Germany and Switzerland, donated both their time and their fuel to the effort.

For young spectators, the chance to sit inside a sports car or hear the growl of a V12 engine was nothing short of magical. “I’ve never been this close to a race car before,” said twelve-year-old Lukas, beaming after his first ride in a Porsche 911. His mother added that the experience brought much-needed joy during her son’s ongoing medical treatments.

Making a Tangible Impact

By the end of the day, the event had raised tens of thousands of euros, with donations earmarked for pediatric care and family support initiatives in the region. Local officials praised the effort as a model of how passion and philanthropy can intersect.

“This is a beautiful example of how a community can unite around something fun and meaningful,” said Mayor Sabine Hoffmann. “The Hegau charity drive is more than just a motor show—it’s a celebration of compassion.”

Looking Ahead

Encouraged by this year’s success, organizers have already announced plans to expand the event next year, adding more cars, interactive workshops for children, and expanded partnerships with local charities.

As the engines quieted and the crowds dispersed, one sentiment lingered: in Hegau, the love for fast cars had translated into something far more powerful—hope and happiness for those in need.

"After message protests Trump, Carnegie Mellon University temporarily closes The Fence.

The Fence at Carnegie Mellon University has become a staple for students to display messages on campus. 

Whether it be advertising their organization or giving a take on current events, it has served as a way to express their speech. But in a letter to students, CMU President Farnam Jahanian said The Fence is closing after a recent message protesting President Trump. 

The Fence sits as just a white fence now in the center of the campus. No messages, no pictures, just a plain fence. This comes after ""no rapists on our campus"" was painted during the AI and energy summit at Carnegie Mellon on Tuesday. 

CMU's administration decided to paint over it and close it until sometime next week.  

""It strikes me as very uncharacteristic and concerning to see that they've made the decision to censor speech on campus,"" said Anthony Cacciato, a CMU senior and member of the College Republicans.

Cacciato said CMU has championed free speech, and this goes against it. While he didn't agree with the message, he says students had a right to say it. 

River Sepinuck, a junior at CMU and communications chair of the College Democrats, said it's disappointing the university is censoring students. His group met with university leadership about The Fence.

""Unfortunately, [Jahanian] spent most of the meeting talking down to us, which we were disappointed by. We were hoping to get some form of concrete action about the change in policies surrounding The Fence,"" Sepinuck said.

Earlier in the week, ""protest the summit"" was written and protected by the school with space for the students to address their concerns about Tuesday's event. In a message from the university's president, he says CMU supports peaceful protest, public dissent, and the exchange of ideas. It goes on to say that after messages equating Nazism, Zionism and Hindutva earlier this year and this latest message, the school is looking at how to move forward.

""It would be a great disservice to the culture on campus and the students on campus to go back and renege on this commitment to free speech that has been a cornerstone of how Carnegie Mellon has conducted itself in the past,"" Cacciato said.

Jahanian's letter says recent years have seen more messages disconnected from ""meaningful dialogue."" Cacciato said once messages are allowed back, no one should feel a chilling effect to say their thoughts. Sepinuck says there is most certainly a chilling effect moving forward.

""Knowing that just by unilateral decision, that President Jahanian can say, 'I don't like and I'm going to paint over it,' it makes us more hesitant to paint on The Fence,"" Sepinuck said.

According to CMU, it looks to reaffirm the purpose of the tradition. No word on when next week messages may resume.",https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/carnegie-mellon-university-the-fence-closed-trump/,real,0

After Message Protests Trump, Carnegie Mellon University Temporarily Closes The Fence

Pittsburgh, PA — July 28, 2025

Carnegie Mellon University has temporarily closed access to its iconic Fence after a politically charged message appeared late Sunday night that read: ""TRUMP IS ON THE EPSTEIN LIST.""

The message, painted in large block letters by an anonymous group of students, drew a crowd of onlookers by early Monday morning. The Fence — a longstanding campus landmark where students express everything from birthday wishes to political statements — quickly became the center of heated discussion, with some praising the act as courageous free speech and others condemning it as inflammatory and inappropriate.

By noon, university administrators had surrounded The Fence with temporary fencing of their own, citing “safety and operational concerns.” In an official statement, the Office of Student Affairs explained:

“While Carnegie Mellon strongly supports freedom of expression, recent activity at The Fence has raised concerns about escalating tensions and community impact. We are temporarily suspending access to The Fence while we assess the situation and engage student leaders.”

The statement did not reference the message itself, but sources within the administration confirmed to The Tartan that complaints from alumni, donors, and local officials played a role in the decision to close the area.

Within hours of the closure, photos of the painted message had gone viral on social media platforms, with hashtags like #FenceGate, #CMUUnfiltered, and #EpsteinList trending regionally. The image even caught the attention of several national commentators.

“Whatever you think about the message, silencing student voices like this doesn’t look good,” tweeted Sarah Velasquez, editor at Campus Watchdog, a national college journalism platform. “The Fence has always been raw and political. That’s kind of the point.”

Despite the temporary closure, students have already begun chalking nearby sidewalks with slogans in support of the original message, and a student-organized protest is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon at the Cut.

“This isn’t just about Trump or Epstein,” said junior engineering major Alex Tran. “It’s about whether the administration respects the voice of its students — even when it’s uncomfortable.”

CMU has not given a timeline for when access to The Fence will be restored. Meanwhile, debate over the university’s role in moderating political speech continues to ripple far beyond campus.","Generate a fake news article for me with the title ""

"Nurses at UPMC's Magee-Womens Hospital vote to unionize.

PITTSBURGH, August 26, 2025 — In a significant move for healthcare labor relations, nurses at UPMC's Magee-Womens Hospital have voted to unionize, marking a pivotal moment in the hospital’s history and potentially reshaping workplace dynamics for hundreds of healthcare professionals.

A Historic Vote

The vote comes after months of organizing efforts, petitions, and discussions among nurses concerned about working conditions, patient care standards, and the need for a stronger collective voice. While exact numbers have not been disclosed, organizers described the result as a “clear majority” in favor of forming a union.

“This decision shows that nurses are ready to stand together to advocate for ourselves, our patients, and the quality of care we provide,” said one nurse who participated in the campaign.

Key Drivers Behind the Push

Several factors appear to have driven the unionization effort:

Staffing Levels and Burnout
Nurses have voiced ongoing concerns about staffing shortages and heavy patient loads, issues exacerbated by the long-lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fair Wages and Benefits
As healthcare costs rise, many nurses have pushed for wage adjustments and improved benefits to reflect their critical role in patient care.

Patient Safety and Quality of Care
Some nurses expressed that having a collective voice would help ensure hospital policies prioritize safe staffing and patient outcomes.

Hospital Response

UPMC leadership released a brief statement following the vote, expressing respect for the nurses’ decision and pledging to work collaboratively with the newly formed union.

“We value the incredible contributions our nurses make every day and remain committed to providing an environment that supports exceptional care,” the statement read. “We look forward to engaging in good-faith discussions as we move forward.”

What Happens Next

With the vote secured, nurses will begin the process of selecting union representatives and entering negotiations with hospital management. The bargaining process is expected to focus on issues such as staffing ratios, pay scales, scheduling practices, and protections against mandatory overtime.

Labor experts note that initial negotiations at hospitals often take several months, but they emphasize that successful contracts can bring lasting improvements to working conditions and employee retention.

Part of a Broader Trend

The Magee-Womens Hospital vote reflects a growing trend of union activity among healthcare workers nationwide. In recent years, nurses and other medical professionals across the country have increasingly sought collective bargaining rights, citing burnout, resource shortages, and a desire for greater influence in hospital decision-making.

“This is about having a seat at the table,” said another nurse involved in the organizing campaign. “We want to make sure our voices are heard when policies impact our patients and our profession.”","generate a news article based on this title without searching on the web: ""Nurses at UPMC's Magee-Womens Hospital vote to unionize""",fake,1
"Nurses at UPMC's Magee-Womens Hospital vote to unionize.

Nurses at UPMC’s Magee-Womens Hospital have voted to unionize with SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania. About 1,000 registered nurses will be represented by the union, a major milestone in SEIU’s long-running effort to organize UPMC’s flagship hospitals in Oakland.
Nurses cast their ballots on Aug. 19 and 23. Votes were counted over the weekend, according to SEIU, with the final count tallying 402 to 305 in support of joining the union.
“My coworkers and I are absolutely overjoyed to finally win a union voice for our patients, our profession and our community,” Jenna Berry, a registered nurse at the Magee Women’s Cancer Center said in a statement. “We call on UPMC executives to respect the voice of the clear majority and begin negotiations with us right away.”
In a statement, UPMC said it looks forward to collaborating with SEIU.
""We respect the decision of UPMC Magee nurses to unionize with the SEIU and look forward to building a strong and respectful partnership,"" the statement said.
""We remain committed to fostering a collaborative work environment focused on providing exceptional care for our patients,"" it continued.

One of the region’s largest labor and delivery centers, where nearly half of Allegheny County’s babies are born each year, organizing nurses at Magee-Womens Hospital could be a watershed moment for SEIU. The union has sought to organize UPMC hospitals for more than a decade.
Magee nurses are the latest in a national trend of medical professionals organizing across the country, often citing burnout, working conditions and a desire for more input over patient care. All three were issues highlighted by Magee nurses as they sought to organize with SEIU over the last year.
“The healthcare system in our state and our country has been heading in the wrong direction, and that’s why doctors, nurses, advanced practitioners and other healthcare workers are standing up for ourselves and those we care for,” said Ashley Grieco, a registered nurse in Magee’s neonatal intensive care unit. “We have to take a stand for our professions and our community, because we’ve learned that no one else will.”
SEIU has claimed that the size of the Magee nurses unit marks the biggest union election in recent Pennsylvania history. A smaller group of Magee health professionals, known as advanced practitioners, are set to vote on whether to form another unit in September.
Magee nurses are now expected to begin negotiations with UPMC to draw up their first union contract.
“The input of all nurses and all departments is important in our contract negotiations to ensure Magee continues to be the very best place to practice nursing and receive medical care,” Berry said. “We look forward to working with UPMC for the future success of our hospital.”
Magee nurses plan to hold a rally Tuesday to celebrate with the community at Zelema Parklet, near the hospital.",https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2025-08-25/nurses-magee-womens-hospital-upmc-union,real,0
"Work to build bridge linking Marina Centre and Gardens by the Bay to start in Q1 2026.

Construction of a long-awaited pedestrian bridge connecting Marina Centre to Gardens by the Bay is set to begin in the first quarter of 2026, according to an announcement from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) today.

The new bridge, designed to enhance connectivity and walkability in the Marina Bay area, will span across the Marina Channel, offering a direct link between the bustling commercial hub of Marina Centre and the scenic waterfront gardens — a move expected to improve pedestrian flow and accessibility for both locals and tourists.

Seamless Integration with Existing Landmarks

The structure will integrate with existing walkways and cycling paths, including the Marina Promenade and the Bay East Garden trail. Once completed, visitors can walk or cycle uninterrupted from Suntec City and the Singapore Flyer to Gardens by the Bay and beyond.

URA said the bridge will incorporate “green and inclusive design principles,” including barrier-free access, rain shelters, energy-efficient lighting, and native landscaping. The bridge is expected to serve as both a functional link and an architectural landmark.

Part of Larger Connectivity Push

This project is part of a broader push to enhance first- and last-mile connections in Singapore’s city centre. In recent years, the government has prioritized active mobility infrastructure as part of its car-lite vision for Singapore.

“The new bridge is a key piece of the puzzle in realising a more walkable and connected city,” said Ms. Ang Li Yen, Group Director of Development Control at URA. “It will offer residents and visitors a safe, scenic, and sustainable way to experience the Marina Bay area.”

Construction Timeline and Expected Completion

Work is scheduled to begin between January and March 2026, with completion targeted for late 2028. Temporary access arrangements and detours around Marina Centre and the Marina Barrage area may be introduced during construction.

Public Reception and Economic Impact

Local businesses and tourism stakeholders have welcomed the announcement, noting that the bridge could increase footfall and improve visitor experiences in one of Singapore’s most iconic districts.

“With a direct link to Gardens by the Bay, we expect more tourists to explore both sides of the bay without needing transport,” said Mr. Joseph Tan, general manager of a hotel in Marina Square. “It’s a win for accessibility and urban design.”

Further updates on bridge design details and construction logistics are expected to be released later this year.",generate a news article with the following title: Work to build bridge linking Marina Centre and Gardens by the Bay to start in Q1 2026,fake,1
"Work to build bridge linking Marina Centre and Gardens by the Bay to start in Q1 2026.

SINGAPORE – Work on a new pedestrian and cycling bridge in Marina Bay connecting Marina Centre to the Gardens by the Bay’s Bay East Garden will start in the first quarter of 2026, with completion slated by 2029.

The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) called a pre-qualification tender for the design and construction on July 17, requiring the structure to look simple, elegant and timeless, as well as have “outstanding architectural merit”.

The details came after an unveiling of these plans in URA’s Draft Master Plan 2025 on June 25.

According to tender documents published on government procurement portal GeBiz on July 17, the bridge will be built parallel to a section of the Benjamin Sheares Bridge linking Marina Centre to Tanjong Rhu.

The bridge will facilitate the movement of pedestrians, cyclists and people with disabilities between Marina Centre and Bay East Garden, where the future Founders’ Memorial will be situated, added URA.

It said the bridge should also cater for mass events such as marathons, jogathons and walkathons.

The bridge must be able to accommodate people mover systems such as buggies, to allow visitors to shuttle conveniently between Bay East Garden and the future Bay Central Garden at Marina Centre.

The Straits Times reported in 2022 that there were no immediate plans to develop the Bay Central Garden, which will feature a 3km waterfront promenade stretching from the Singapore Flyer area to Crawford Bridge in Kampong Bugis.

Noting that the new bridge connecting the city to the East Coast area will be prominently positioned within the Marina Channel, URA said it will become a distinctive feature of the waterfront as it will be exceptionally visible from multiple vantage points.

These points refer to a waterfront promenade at Marina Centre and the upcoming Bay East Garden in Gardens by the Bay, where residents and visitors gather for leisure.

The authority added that the bridge will also form a backdrop for high-profile international events, including the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix and water sports competitions in the Marina Channel, so it must exhibit “exceptional design excellence” to be on a par with the bridges nearby.

Some bridges at the waterfront include the Jubilee Bridge, the Helix, the Benjamin Sheares Bridge and an upcoming one connecting Garden by the Bay’s Bay South Garden and Bay East Garden.

URA said the design of the new bridge should make a meaningful visual statement in the Marina Channel, while complementing the design of the Benjamin Sheares Bridge.

It added that the deck – or walkway – of the bridge should have a “lightweight appearance”, as if it is floating above the water.

The authority noted that while construction of the bridge is ongoing, the successful tenderer must still allow water-going vessels to travel along clear routes in the affected portion of the Marina Channel.

The contractor should also ensure continuous public access – by foot or cycling – along a park connector network by maintaining alternative routes at Bay East Garden and Marina Centre.

People can now get from Marina Centre to Bay East Garden via the Marina Barrage Dam. This route could take more than an hour by foot or around 20 minutes by cycling as it involves travelling down the Helix Bridge, along the waterfront of Gardens by the Bay, across the Marina Barrage Dam, and then along the waterfront of Bay East Garden.

Alternatively, pedestrians can walk along the Benjamin Sheares Bridge, which is part of the ECP. This includes walking up and down several flights of stairs.

The tender documents show that all construction work within the Marina Channel would need to be stopped during several upcoming large-scale international sporting events.

These include the Asia Pacific Sprint Cup in April or May 2027, the Asian Dragon Boat Championships in October 2028, trial games for the 2029 SEA Games in the second half of 2028, as well as the SEA Games estimated to take place from June 2029, according to Sport Singapore.

The tender documents also show that the Singapore Tourism Board requested a halt to structural work along or adjacent to the waterfront promenade eight weeks before and during the annual Formula One race periods.

The other authorities involved as stakeholders in this tender include the National Parks Board, which gave recommendations for the landscaping at both ends of the bridge, and national water agency PUB, which will oversee pollution control for the work.

Another stakeholder is the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), which is currently involved in constructing NS Square at the former The Float @ Marina Bay site.

This is because the appointed contractor will be sharing the only approved slipway along Republic Avenue with DSTA to carry out work.

The scope of work listed in the tender includes the engagement of a lighting specialist to design night lighting for the bridge, a certified arborist and horticulturist to manage the trees, as well as a landscape specialist to design the greenery at both ends of the bridge.

The tender for the design and construction of the bridge will close at 4pm on Aug 7.

"""Nanjing Hong Jie"" has been arrested!.

**Nanjing, China — July 23, 2025** —
In a dramatic development that has sent shockwaves through financial and political circles, the figure known publicly as ""Nanjing Hong Jie"" (literally ""Sister Hong of Nanjing"") has been arrested, authorities confirmed Wednesday morning. The arrest is part of a sweeping anti-fraud operation targeting an intricate web of illicit investment schemes that spanned across multiple provinces in China.

---

### **Who Is “Nanjing Hong Jie”?**

""Nanjing Hong Jie,"" whose real name authorities identified as Hong Lihua (洪丽华), rose to regional prominence over the last five years through livestreaming platforms and investment seminars. Often clad in red — the color of prosperity — and speaking in an endearing Nanjing dialect, she cultivated an image as a grassroots financial mentor, especially popular among middle-aged and elderly audiences.

What began as a modest WeChat-based financial advice group ballooned into what prosecutors are now calling a ""deceptively structured pyramid investment scheme involving tens of millions of yuan.""

---

### **The Arrest**

The arrest took place late Tuesday night at a private villa on the outskirts of Suzhou, where Hong had reportedly been residing under a different name for several weeks. A joint task force of Jiangsu Provincial Police and officers from the Ministry of Public Security carried out the operation following months of surveillance.

“She was cooperative, but clearly aware we were coming,” said Senior Inspector Liu Wen, one of the lead investigators on the case. “We found several mobile phones, encrypted USB drives, and large volumes of investor records in her possession.”

---

### **The Scheme: Promises of High Returns, Backed by Personality**

Investigators say Hong’s scheme targeted working-class retirees and small business owners, enticing them with promises of 12% monthly returns through what she claimed were “short-term urban development funds” and “renovation bonds” supposedly backed by Nanjing municipal projects.

In reality, the funds were neither registered nor traceable, and prosecutors allege that new investor money was used to pay earlier participants — classic hallmarks of a Ponzi scheme.

One alleged victim, Zhang Ruifen, a 62-year-old retiree from Yancheng, recounted how she invested her entire pension savings of 180,000 yuan after attending one of Hong’s community seminars. “She spoke like an older sister. She even called me 'mei mei' (little sister) and said she would never cheat her own people.”

---

### **Legal and Financial Implications**

As of this morning, over 300 people have filed reports with police claiming financial losses. Early estimates place the total amount of money involved in the scheme at over 190 million yuan (\$26 million USD), though that number is expected to rise as the investigation continues.

The Ministry of Public Security issued a statement calling the case “a stark reminder of the dangers of unregulated financial advice and grassroots investment networks” and emphasized its commitment to “pursuing justice for victims and holding perpetrators accountable.”

Legal analysts expect the case to become a landmark example in the government’s ongoing crackdown on financial fraud — a key pillar of President Xi Jinping’s campaign to stabilize grassroots financial systems.

---

### **Public Reaction**

Online reaction has been intense. On Weibo, hashtags such as **#NanjingHongJieArrested** and **#FinancialFraudAwareness** were trending by noon, with some expressing outrage while others voiced sympathy, calling her “misguided but not malicious.”

“I think she started with good intentions but got in over her head,” wrote one user. “She isn’t just a criminal, she’s a mirror of how financially desperate and trusting our elders can be.”

---

### **Next Steps**

Hong is currently being held at an undisclosed detention center in Nanjing. Authorities say formal charges will be announced by the end of the week. A task force has been set up to trace investor funds, and officials say a restitution mechanism will be launched after forensic accounting reviews are completed.

Meanwhile, public prosecutors have urged victims who have not yet come forward to contact their local police stations or use the dedicated reporting portal launched this morning.

"""Nanjing Hong Jie"" has been arrested!.

The reporter learned from relevant police sources that the man involved in the rumor that a 60-year-old uncle in Nanjing dressed as a woman and had intimate behavior with 1,691 men and filmed a ""dating"" video (known as ""Red Old Man"" on the Internet) has been arrested by the public security organs. Among them, the relevant information circulated on the Internet has been exaggerated at will, and the relevant case is currently under investigation.

Related legal experts told reporters that if the perpetrator knowingly has AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, etc. and deliberately has unprotected sex with an unspecified majority of people, it may cause the risk of large-scale disease transmission, and is suspected of constituting the crime of endangering public security by dangerous means. According to Articles 114 and 115 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, if this crime is committed and no serious consequences have been caused, a fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 3 years but not more than 10 years shall be imposed; if it causes serious injury, death, or causes major losses to public or private property, a fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 10 years, life imprisonment or death shall be imposed.

"Yellow high temperature warning: The highest temperature in parts of Chongqing, Hubei and other five provinces and cities will exceed 40℃.

August 25, 2025 – The National Meteorological Center has issued a yellow high temperature warning as large parts of central and southwestern China brace for extreme heat. Forecasters predict that the maximum temperature in Chongqing, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang will climb above 40℃ in the coming days, with some local areas possibly surpassing historical records.

Heatwave Conditions Intensify

Since mid-August, much of China has experienced persistent heat due to strong subtropical high pressure. Meteorological experts note that this round of high temperatures is more intense and prolonged than earlier in the summer. Urban areas such as Chongqing’s central districts and Wuhan in Hubei are expected to see consecutive days of extreme heat, with nighttime temperatures staying above 28℃, creating “tropical night” conditions that hinder cooling and rest.

Health and Safety Concerns

Authorities are urging residents to take protective measures against heat-related illnesses. The elderly, children, outdoor workers, and those with chronic diseases are considered most vulnerable. Hospitals in affected regions have already reported an uptick in heatstroke cases. The Ministry of Emergency Management has advised local governments to strengthen monitoring of electricity and water supply systems, as soaring demand for air conditioning is straining the power grid.

Impact on Agriculture and Infrastructure

Prolonged high temperatures are also affecting agricultural production, particularly rice and corn crops in Hunan and Jiangxi, where drought conditions are worsening. In some hilly areas of Sichuan, soil moisture has dropped sharply, raising the risk of forest fires. Highway authorities in Chongqing and Hubei have been put on alert for road surface deformation due to extreme heat.

Public Guidance

Meteorological experts recommend the following precautions:

Avoid outdoor activities during peak sunlight hours (11 a.m.–4 p.m.).

Stay hydrated and consume light, easily digestible meals.

Use cooling appliances but conserve electricity when possible.

Pay close attention to updates from local weather services.

The high temperature warning is expected to remain in place for at least the next three to five days, with potential extension if the subtropical high continues to dominate. Authorities emphasize that communities must remain vigilant, as sustained extreme heat can escalate into severe drought and compound risks for both public health and economic stability.","generate an article titled : Yellow high temperature warning: The highest temperature in parts of Chongqing, Hubei and other five provinces and cities will exceed 40℃",fake,1
